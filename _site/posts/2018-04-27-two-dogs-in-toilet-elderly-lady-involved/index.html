<p>Animals get stuck in weird places, just ask <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/resource/e6211993-9ea2-4ed4-9378-7344653e9c31">the London Fire Brigade</a>. I used <a href="https://github.com/r-spatial/sf">the {sf} package</a> to handling some animal rescue spatial data prior to <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">interactive mapping with {leaflet}</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Sometimes I need to convert coordinate data to latitude and longitude for interactive mapping using the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">{leaflet}</a> package in R.</p>
<p>I’m going to demo the {sf} package, show how to reproject coordinates, work with points and polygon data, make an interactive map with {leaflet} and do a bonus bit of webscraping.</p>

<section id="special-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="special-features">Special features</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/r-spatial/sf">{sf} (‘simple features’) package</a> from <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8049-7069">Edzer Pebesma</a> has a series of classes and methods for spatial data. The package is becoming popular because simple feature access is a widely-used multi-platform <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html">ISO standard</a> and the package supports the popular <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">tidy data</a> paradigm and can be integrated with <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse operations</a>. This and more was <a href="https://edzer.github.io/UseR2017/">spelled out by Pebesma in a post</a> from <a href="https://user2017.brussels/">UseR! 2017</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about anlyses with {sf} in <a href="https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/">Geocomputation with R</a> by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad and Jannes Muenchow.</p>

<section id="data-animal-rescues" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-animal-rescues">Data: animal rescues</h2>
<p>I’ve found an interesting example dataset that contains eastings and northings: <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/resource/e6211993-9ea2-4ed4-9378-7344653e9c31">animal rescue incidents</a> attended by the <a href="https://www.london-fire.gov.uk/incidents/">London Fire Brigade</a> from the excellent <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/">London Data Store</a>. In their words:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The London Fire Brigade attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call ‘special services’). These ‘special services’ include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is close to my heart because a pigeon fell down our chimney recently. After a brave rescue mission (putting on some rubber gloves and contorting my arms through a tiny vent hole) I think I’m now qualified to join an elite search and rescue team.</p>
<section id="clean" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clean">Clean</h3>
<p>We can read the data directly from <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/resource/e6211993-9ea2-4ed4-9378-7344653e9c31">the datastore</a> as a CSV file.</p>

<p>So each row is an ‘incident’ to which the brigade were called and there’s 9728 of them recorded in the dataset. There are 31 columns for variables relating to incident, including when it was, what it was and where it was.</p>

<p>This post isn’t about the dataset, but it’s worth having a closer look at it. I’ve added an interactive table below so you can search for incidents, creatures, locations and the notional cost of the callout.</p>

<section id="data-points" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-points">Data: points</h2>
<p>Each incident in our data is a point in space with an X and Y coordinate. It’s currently eastings and northings, but we want to transform it to latitude and longitude.</p>
<section id="the-sf-class-and-reprojection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-sf-class-and-reprojection">The sf class and reprojection</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system">Coordinate Reference System</a> (CRS) is required to project geographic entities – points, polygons, etc – onto a surface. There are many systems for doing this, from local to global, each with its own CRS code. This isn’t a post about geography and projections, but you can read more in the CRS chapter of <a href="http://rspatial.org/spatial/rst/6-crs.html">rspatial.org</a>.</p>
<p>First we convert the our dataframe-class object an ‘sf’ class object using the <code>st_as_sf</code> function, which readies it for spatial analysis. We simply provide arguments that point to the columns containing the coordinates and the CRS code for that projection system.</p>
<p>We can then use the <code>st_transform()</code> function to convert our projection system from eastings and northings to to latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>So what happened more specifically? Our eastings and northings were combined with <code>st_as_sf()</code> into a two element <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls13_list-columns.html">list-column</a> called <code>geometry</code> with data type <code>sfc_POINT</code>. Our new sf-class object also contains some metadata detailing the geometry type – <code>POINTS</code> in our case – and the projection system of the coordinate data, which we converted to latlong with the <code>st_transform()</code> function.</p>
</section>
<section id="tidyverse-manipulation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tidyverse-manipulation">Tidyverse manipulation</h3>
<p>As mentioned, one advantage of using {sf} is that sf-class objects use the <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">tidy data</a> paradigm that allows for use of the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>. Some users may prefer this relative to the ‘Spatial Points Data Frame’ (SPDF) class that is produced by the {sp} package for points data. SPDFs are an <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html">S4 class</a>, which means they have ‘slots’ of data, coordinates, etc.</p>
<p>In the code chunk above I used pipes to pass the <code>rescue</code> dataframe to <code>st_as_sf()</code> and then to <code>st_transform()</code>. You can also use {dplyr} functions like <code>filter()</code> on your sf-class object.</p>

<p>We can also use the <code>st_coordinates()</code> function to extract the XY (latitude and longitude) coordinates from the column containing our {sf} point geometry. This means we can have separate columns for the latitude and longitude, as well as our list-column.</p>

<p>This means our polygon dataset is a tidy dataframe with the polygon information stored as <code>MULTIPOLYGON</code> type in a list-column with as many elements as required to draw each polygon (e.g.&nbsp;a square requires four sets of XY points that can be joined together). The outcome is very similar to what we had for our points data.</p>

<p>So now we can plot the data. The <code>addPolygons()</code> function accepts each <code>MULTIPOLYGON</code> in the list-column of our London boroughs dataset. The <code>addMarkers()</code> function accepts the POINTS-type list-column to plot each point at the latitude and longitude specified.</p>
<p>This is a very simple map for now. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>zoom with the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> buttons or scroll with your mouse wheel</li>
<li>click and drag to move the map</li>
<li>click the points to get a pop-up showing more information</li>
<li>hover over a borough to highlight it and show a label</li>
</ul>
