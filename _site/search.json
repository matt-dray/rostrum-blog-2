    "text": "tl;dr\nWebR lets you run R in the browser(!). Now you can make WebR chunks in Quarto that render to editable, executable blocks(!).\n\n\nSliding into tedium\nI wrote recently a simple introduction to how R parses code. I provided a function that I said the reader could go away and run themselves.\nAs in… copy-paste it into an instance of R running on their machine. Gross.\nWouldn’t it be better if people could just tinker with the code right there in the post? This kind of ‘playground’ could be great for explaining concepts and teaching.1\n\n\nI seesaw a solution\nWebR lets you run R in the browser. Read that again! This is a landmark piece of work from George Stagg and Lionel Henry.\nI won’t go into technicals and limitations here. For more information, see:\n\nthe docs\nthe v0.1 launch post\nan ‘awesome’ list of resources\n\nCrucially for my needs, you can now run WebR chunks in a Quarto document, thanks to James J Balamuta. This renders interactive blocks of R code that the reader can adjust and execute with button-click:\n\n\n\nBeware: this is a gif, not an embedded demo!\n\n\nCheck out James’s coatless/quarto-webr GitHub repo for the source. There’s also a live demo and its source.\n\n\nSwinging into action\nTo have a go yourself, do follow the setup steps in James’s quarto-webr README and look at the source of his demo.\nUltimately you can:\n\nInstall the extension to your project folder by running quarto add coatless/quarto-webr in the terminal\nSet filter: webr in the YAML of your qmd file2\nWrite code chunks in the qmd using the {webr} engine\n\nThis made it straightforward to prepare a little Quarto doc with chunks powered by the ‘webr’ engine, which I deployed to the web via Netlify.3\nYou can visit that live page or see the underlying source on GitHub.4\nSo now you can tinker with the example I gave in the original blogpost about parsing R code. Unfortunately I can’t add this directly to the post, since this blog is not made with Quarto.\n\n\nA blog-platform merry-go-round\nI’ve written this quick demo and post because I was excited about what George & Lionel and James have put together. There’s so many system-independent applications of this approach that could help with teaching and learning, or explaining simple ideas in a blog post.\nIn fact, this blog may eventually switch from {blogdown} to Quarto to take advantage of WebR. It’ll be a pain to convert old posts, but luckily I already missed the earlier {blogdown}-to-{distill} bandwagon, lol.5\n\n\n\nSession info\n\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22)\n os       macOS Big Sur/Monterey 10.16\n system   x86_64, darwin17.0\n ui       X11\n language (EN)\n collate  en_US.UTF-8\n ctype    en_US.UTF-8\n tz       Europe/London\n date     2023-04-10\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n cli           3.6.0   2023-01-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n digest        0.6.31  2022-12-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n evaluate      0.20    2023-01-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n fastmap       1.1.0   2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n htmltools     0.5.2   2021-08-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n htmlwidgets   1.5.4   2021-09-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n jsonlite      1.8.4   2022-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n knitr         1.42    2023-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rlang         1.0.6   2022-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rmarkdown     2.14    2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rstudioapi    0.14    2022-08-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n sessioninfo   1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n xfun          0.37    2023-01-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n yaml          2.3.7   2023-01-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n\n [1] /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nA nice example of this in a teaching context is W3 Schools, who have a ‘Try It Yourself’ space that lets you take code from the lessons and tinker with it yourself in the browser.↩︎\nSet also engine: knitr in the YAML to use {knitr} instead of Jupyter to handle the conversion.

    "section": "",
    "text": "tl;dr\nR is ‘a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics’. Ahahaha, no it’s not, it’s a game engine. I’ve created a ‘splendid’ list of games you can play—written in R—to prove it. Help expand it.\n\n\nStats only!\nR is not a general, multi-purpose programming language. It was written to do statistical analysis and make charts. You are literally not allowed to do anything else with it. You should use <LANGUAGE> instead, which is much more suited to your specific use case. R is a joke language for nerds.\nYou should not read beyond this point if you think, quite rightly, that mirth and frivolity are unsuited to an R session.\n\n\nStats only?\nUnity. Unreal. GameMaker. Godot. All of these videogame engines are now obsolete.\nIt is R—humble R!—that represents the future of gaming.\nTo prove it, I’ve created a list of ‘splendid R games’ in a GitHub repo1 that you are welcome to contribute to.2\nYes, R can be used for fun. Do not tell R Core.\n\n\nWait, he’s serious?\nI think there’s three kinds of ‘platform’ for games written in R:\n\nFor the console\nIn Shiny\nPorted\n\nGames played in the console are pretty straightforward and probably most common. You can run some code, or a function from a package, to launch some code in the R console that you can interact with. A simple option for this might involve use of readline() to receive user input, for example, like Giora Simchoni’s excellent text-based puzzler, Castle of R.\n\n\n\nGiora’s Castle of R running in the terminal.\n\n\nShiny can give you a little more flexibility when it comes to graphics and user input, at the expense of needing to host the app and maybe some extra JavaScript skills. A great example of this is Pedro Silva’s winning entry (app, source) to the Posit Shiny contest in 2020.\n\n\n\nA still from Pedro’s Shiny Decisions app.\n\n\nThe third category is a little more boundary-pushing. Imagine if R was powerful enough to let you port existing games. Well, surprise, ya boi Mike Cheng (aka coolbutuseless) has pushed hard on expanding the capabilities of R to run fast enough and with realtime user input,3 porting the classic Another World (1991) to R, which was showcased at 2022’s Posit conference (source, video, blog).\n\n\n\nA still from Mike’s rstudio::conf(2022) presentation, featuring Another World.\n\n\nOf course, within these ‘platforms’ are genres like word games, arcade games, puzzle games, etc. Will you be the first to create an MMORPG (a massively-multiplayer online R-powered game)?\n\n\nI am an indie game dev now\nI’ve always been interested in how videogames are coded,4 wishing that I could do the same myself. Of course I could simply learn ‘real’ programming languages.\nExcept that’s blasphemy. Of course I’d rather break my own mind and spirit in an attempt to make R achieve 0.1% of what might be possible in P*thon.\nCase in point, I’ve made a few R packages containing some little toys (in order of gooddest to baddest):\n\n{r.oguelike} (source, blogs) for a procedural-dungeon explorer with enemy pathfinding and inventory\n{tamRgo} (source, blog) for a cyber pet in your R console that persists between sessions\n{safar6} (source, blog) for a text-based re-make of the Safari Zone from the first generation of Pokémon games\n{ActionSquirrel} (source, blog) for a tile-based, turn-based minigame in the R console\n{hokey} (source, blog) for minigames that use direct keypress inputs with {keypress}\n\n\n\n\nHint when playing {tamRgo}: do not forget about your pet for 138 days. RIP Kevin XVIII.\n\n\nI’ve got something in the pipeline that involves extremely rudimentary physics in the R console. Wow! For release in 2023 (because game launches never go wrong).\n\n\nReady Player 2\nThe splendid list must be missing a bunch of games. Please leave an issue or pull request in the splendid-r-games repo to add more examples.\nNext stop: letting people run R games in the browser without an installed copy of R. This is already possible with a service like Binder, which can spin up an instance of RStudio with packages pre-installed I did this for {r.oguelike}).\n\n\n\nJust like the Nokia N-Gage, amirite?\n\n\nBut soon you might be able to use WebR to play games in the browser without even spinning up RStudio, ooh. So look out for an R version of itch.io in future, lol.\n\n\n\nSession info\n\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22)\n os       macOS Big Sur/Monterey 10.16\n system   x86_64, darwin17.0\n ui       X11\n language (EN)\n collate  en_US.UTF-8\n ctype    en_US.UTF-8\n tz       Europe/London\n date     2023-04-10\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n cli           3.6.0   2023-01-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n digest        0.6.31  2022-12-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n evaluate      0.20    2023-01-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n fastmap       1.1.0   2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n htmltools     0.5.2   2021-08-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n htmlwidgets   1.5.4   2021-09-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n jsonlite      1.8.4   2022-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n knitr         1.42    2023-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rlang         1.0.6   2022-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rmarkdown     2.14    2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rstudioapi    0.14    2022-08-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n sessioninfo   1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n xfun          0.37    2023-01-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n yaml          2.3.7   2023-01-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n\n [1] /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI originally labelled the GitHub repo as an ‘awesome’ repo, which I later learned has a very specific meaning.

As usual.↩︎\nSee the {nara} and {eventloop} packages in particular.↩︎\nI like YouTube devlogs by folks like Seb Lague, ThinMatrix, SquidGod, Jonas, TanTan and others.

Do you sometimes feel like you’re ticking boxes instead of actually developing your skills? Yeah, me too. Luckily, more active styles of learning are available.

The talk will involve a detour to an underground cave, but you won’t need any extra equipment.3\n\nYes, a cheeky teaser there to pique the interest. But everyone came to my talk anyway because it was the only one at that timeslot.\nYou can just look at the slides below if you want (direct link, source). Press ‘s’ to pop out the speaker notes.\n\n\nThese were made with Revealjs via Quarto, of course.\n\n\nOn my soapbox\nSo what incredible insight did I bring to the event?\nBasically, I think ‘module-based’ learning—often passive video walkthroughs with comprehension exercises—are too generic and I usually struggle to remember anything from them.\nI think ‘project-based’ learning is preferable. Think about what you actually want to learn and develop a small-scope, discrete project around it. Make the subject matter fun. Fail meaningfully by be being open, recording what you’ve found, and involving your community.\nMy contrived soundbite is that module-based is done to you and project-based is done by you.\nIs this a new thought technology? No. Is it always true and applicable to everyone in every conceivable scenario and with every learning need? No. What’s my expertise? None, really. I’ve just spent a long time in lots of different departments and I can tell you what has worked for me4 as someone who entered the public sector with little computing or coding ability.\nAm I all too aware of how self-indulgent this all sounds? Yes. Did I need a whole talk to explain this? No, probably not. I’m happy if just one person stops to think about this next time they want to learn something. I’m also content if one person panicked slightly when they realised that R is a game engine now.\n\n\n\nSession info\n\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22)\n os       macOS Big Sur/Monterey 10.16\n system   x86_64, darwin17.0\n ui       X11\n language (EN)\n collate  en_US.UTF-8\n ctype    en_US.UTF-8\n tz       Europe/London\n date     2023-04-10\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n cli           3.6.0   2023-01-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n digest        0.6.31  2022-12-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n evaluate      0.20    2023-01-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n fastmap       1.1.0   2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n htmltools     0.5.2   2021-08-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n htmlwidgets   1.5.4   2021-09-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n jsonlite      1.8.4   2022-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n knitr         1.42    2023-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rlang         1.0.6   2022-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rmarkdown     2.14    2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rstudioapi    0.14    2022-08-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n sessioninfo   1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n xfun          0.37    2023-01-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n yaml          2.3.7   2023-01-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n\n [1] /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nOn the same day as train and public sector strikes, oof.↩︎\nI’m becoming more convinced that I don’t know what ‘data scientist’ means anymore. ‘Old man yells at cloud (computing)’, etc.↩︎\nA reference of, course, to my little toy {r.oguelike} project. This is an R package I wrote to achieve some learning goals and also to have some fun; it contains a novelty tile- and turn-based game that the player interacts with in the console. This also fit the themes of the conference—connectivity and patterns—because it contains a procedural dungeon generator and enemy pathfinding.↩︎\nWould’ve been smarter to bring, y’know, actual evidence rather than anecdotes to a data science conference, eh?↩︎\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0"

I have a PhD in Ecology and an MRes in Entomology from Imperial College London, and a BSc in Biology from the University of Sussex.\nIn terms of my research, I am particularly interested in using large scale ecological datasets to answer policy relevant questions. I work on the PREDICTS project with Andy Purvis, looking at how biodiversity responds over time to land-use change and related pressures. My more general interests lie with science policy, statistics and weird and wonderful invertebrates (my favourite being Collembola – the beautiful springtails)."
