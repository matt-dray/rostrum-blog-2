Use the scale_*_continuous() functions to set the axes values, limits, origin and labels.

A bit of trial-and-error will help you find the correct coordinates to place these elements.\n\np4 &lt;- p3 +\n  annotate(\n    geom = \"text\",\n    x = c(1946.1, 1945.9, 1943.75),\n    y = c(10.8, 7.1, 3.2),\n    label = c(\"U.

This means that the majority of regular-season games aren’t too far away.\nBut this varies. Teams are clustered near Lakes Michigan and Erie in the Central division, but the Northwest division stretches from Portland in the Pacific Northwest to Oklahoma City in the centre-south of the country.\nWhat would it take to be a basketball fan who wanted to drive to away games? How long would it take?"

As always, make sure these are installed first, using install.packages().\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  \n  # Tidyverse and friends\n  library(tidyverse)  # data handling and plotting\n  library(rvest)      # scrape data\n  library(janitor)    # misc cleaning\n  \n  # Geography and travel\n  library(sf)         # handle geographies\n  library(osrm)       # fetch travel info\n  \n  # Interactive elements\n  library(leaflet)    # interactive maps\n  library(DT)         # interactive tables\n  library(plotly)     # interactive plots\n  \n})\n\n\n1. Scrape team data\n\nUse {rvest}\nThe Wikipedia page for the NBA has a table with each team and its location, including coordinates. We can use the {rvest} web-scraping package to extract that table into a data frame with these steps:\n\nRead the HTML of the page with xml2::read_html()\nExtract the HTML node for the table with rvest::html_nodes()\nParse the HTML as a table with rvest::html_table()\n\nNote that you have to provide to html_nodes() a CSS selector or an XPath that identifies the table’s ‘location’ in the HTML. You can find these using a tool like SelectorGadget, or with your browser’s ‘inspect’ tool (for Chrome, right-click the element on the page, select ‘inspect’, right-click the HTML for that element, go to ‘Copy’, then ’Copy full XPath). Beware: if the Wikipedia page changes, then this path could change in future.\n\nnba_scrape &lt;-\n  read_html(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association\") %&gt;% \n  html_nodes(xpath = \"/html/body/div[2]/div/div[3]/main/div[3]/div[3]/div[1]/table[4]\") %&gt;%\n  html_table(fill = TRUE, header = NA) %&gt;%\n  .[[1]]  # list was returned, so extract first list element\n\nHere’s a preview:\n\nglimpse(nba_scrape)\n\nRows: 32\nColumns: 9\n$ Division    &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", \"Atlantic\", \"Atlantic\", \"Atlantic\", …\n$ Team        &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", \"Boston Celtics\", \"Brooklyn Nets\", \"…\n$ Location    &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", \"Boston, Massachusetts\", \"New York C…\n$ Arena       &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", \"TD Garden\", \"Barclays Center\", \"Mad…\n$ Capacity    &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", \"19,156\", \"17,732\", \"19,812\", \"20,47…\n$ Coordinates &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", \".mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-…\n$ Founded     &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", \"1946\", \"1967*\", \"1946\", \"1946*\", \"1…\n$ Joined      &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", \"1946\", \"1976\", \"1946\", \"1949\", \"199…\n$ ``          &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern Conference\", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n\n\nSo, the table has been returned, but it needs to be tidied up.\n\n\nWrangle the data\nTo summarise the main cleaning steps required:\n\nremove the rogue NA-filled column\nfilter out the spanning headers that identify the conferences\nadd a column for each team’s conference\nmake numeric the arena capacity\nseparate city and state into separate columns\nisolate the latitude and longitude by separating them from the Coordinates column\nremove the ‘zero width no-break space’ unicode character in the longitude column\nretain only the columns of interest\n\n\nnba_wrangle &lt;- nba_scrape %&gt;% \n  select(-length(.)) %&gt;%  # remove the last column (NA)\n  dplyr::filter(!str_detect(Division, \"Conference\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Conference = c(rep(\"Eastern\", 15), rep(\"Western\", 15)),\n    Capacity = as.numeric(str_remove(Capacity, \",\"))\n  ) %&gt;% \n  separate(Location, c(\"City\", \"State\"), sep = \", \") %&gt;% \n  separate(Coordinates, c(\"Coords1\", \"Coords2\", \"Coords3\"), \" / \") %&gt;% \n  separate(Coords3, c(\"Latitude\", \"Longitude\"), sep = \"; \") %&gt;% \n  separate(Longitude, c(\"Longitude\", \"X\"), sep = \" \\\\(\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    Latitude = as.numeric(Latitude),\n    Longitude = as.numeric(str_remove(Longitude, \"\\\\ufeff\"))  # rogue unicode\n  ) %&gt;% \n  select(\n    Team, Conference, everything(),\n    -Founded, -Joined, -Coords1, -Coords2, -X\n  ) %&gt;% \n  as_tibble()  # convert to tibble\n\nglimpse(nba_wrangle)\n\nRows: 30\nColumns: 9\n$ Team       &lt;chr&gt; \"Boston Celtics\", \"Brooklyn Nets\", \"New York Knicks\", \"Phil…\n$ Conference &lt;chr&gt; \"Eastern\", \"Eastern\", \"Eastern\", \"Eastern\", \"Eastern\", \"Eas…\n$ Division   &lt;chr&gt; \"Atlantic\", \"Atlantic\", \"Atlantic\", \"Atlantic\", \"Atlantic\",…\n$ City       &lt;chr&gt; \"Boston\", \"New York City\", \"New York City\", \"Philadelphia\",…\n$ State      &lt;chr&gt; \"Massachusetts\", \"New York\", \"New York\", \"Pennsylvania\", \"O…\n$ Arena      &lt;chr&gt; \"TD Garden\", \"Barclays Center\", \"Madison Square Garden\", \"W…\n$ Capacity   &lt;dbl&gt; 19156, 17732, 19812, 20478, 19800, 20917, 19432, 20332, 179…\n$ Latitude   &lt;dbl&gt; 42.36630, 40.68265, 40.75056, 39.90111, 43.64333, 41.88056,…\n$ Longitude  &lt;dbl&gt; -71.06223, -73.97469, -73.99361, -75.17194, -79.37917, -87.…\n\n\n\n\nAdd more information\nI made a table of three-letter team codes and colours for the markers and icons that will appear in the pins on the interactive map.

Map the locations\nSo where are all the arenas?\nWe can create a simple interactive map with {leaflet} by plotting the Latitude and Longitude columns and creating custom point markers with a basketball icon and each team’s colours, as well as an information box that appears on-click.\n\nleaflet(nba_table) %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite) %&gt;%  # add basemap\n  addAwesomeMarkers(  # add markers\n    lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude,  # coordinates\n    popup = ~paste0(  # HTML content for popup info\n      \"&lt;b&gt;\", nba_table$Team, \"&lt;/b&gt;\",  # team name\n      \"&lt;br&gt;\", paste0(nba_table$Arena, \", \", nba_table$City),  # location\n      if_else(  # division/conference information\n        nba_table$Conference == \"Eastern\",\n        paste0(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color='#0000FF'&gt;\", nba_table$Division,\n               \" Division (Eastern Conference)&lt;/font&gt;\"),\n        paste0(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;\", nba_table$Division,\n               \" Division (Western Conference)&lt;/font&gt;\")\n      )\n    ),\n    icon = awesomeIcons(\n      library = \"ion\", icon = \"ion-ios-basketball\", # add basketball icon\n      markerColor = nba_table$colour_marker,  # colour the marker\n      iconColor = nba_table$colour_icon  # colour the basketball icon\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  addMeasure()  # add straight-line distance-measuring tool\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can drag and zoom and click the points.\n\n\n3. Get travel duration\nSo how far between these locations?\nThe {osrm} R package from Timothée Giraud, Robin Cura and Matthieu Viry lets you fetch shortest paths and travel times from OpenStreetMap via the OSRM API. It defaults to driving, but you can select walking and biking too. Since we’re using the demo server for OSRM, we can only fetch duration.\n\nDuration matrix\nThe osrm::osrmTable() function takes a data frame (or spatial object) where the first three columns are an identifier and coordinates. The return object is a list, where the first element is a matrix of durations for each pair of points.\n\nnba_locs &lt;- nba_table %&gt;% \n  select(Code, Longitude, Latitude) %&gt;% \n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"Longitude\", \"Latitude\"), crs = 4326)\n\nnba_dur &lt;- osrmTable(loc = nba_locs)\n\nglimpse(nba_dur)\n\nList of 3\n $ durations   : num [1:30, 1:30] 0 282 276 385 650 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  .. ..$ : chr [1:30] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n  .. ..$ : chr [1:30] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ sources     :'data.frame':   30 obs. of  2 variables:\n  ..$ lon: num [1:30] -71.1 -74 -74 -75.2 -79.4 ...\n  ..$ lat: num [1:30] 42.4 40.7 40.7 39.9 43.6 ...\n $ destinations:'data.frame':   30 obs. of  2 variables:\n  ..$ lon: num [1:30] -71.1 -74 -74 -75.2 -79.4 ...\n  ..$ lat: num [1:30] 42.4 40.7 40.7 39.9 43.6 ...\n\n\n\n\nDuration: all teams\nLet’s take this matrix and tidy it into a data frame so there’s one row per team-pair. We can also round to the nearest minute and calculate the nearest number of hours.\n\nnba_dur_all &lt;-\n  as.data.frame(nba_dur$durations) %&gt;% \n  rownames_to_column(\"Start\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(Start = nba_locs$Code) %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~c(\"Start\", nba_locs$Code), all_of(names(.))) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = BKN:SAS,\n    names_to = \"End\",\n    values_to = \"Duration (mins)\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    `Duration (mins)` = round_half_up(`Duration (mins)`),\n    `Duration (hrs)` = round_half_up(`Duration (mins)` / 60)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(`Duration (mins)`))\n\nHere’s a {DT} interactive table sorted by duration that you can filter. Click the ‘CSV’ button to download the data.\n\nnba_dur_all %&gt;% \n  datatable(\n    filter = \"top\",\n    extensions = c(\"Buttons\",\"Scroller\"),\n    class = \"compact\", width = \"100%\",\n    options = list(\n      dom = \"Blrtip\",\n      scroller = TRUE, scrollY = 300,\n      buttons = list(\"csv\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo an incredible 58 hours of driving to get from Miami to Portland.\n\n\nDuration: by division\nWe can also narrow this down to get only the team-pairs that play in the same division as each other.\n\nnba_dur_div &lt;- nba_dur_all %&gt;%\n  left_join(select(nba_table, Code, Division), by = c(\"Start\" = \"Code\")) %&gt;% \n  left_join(select(nba_table, Code, Division), by = c(\"End\" = \"Code\")) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(Division.x == Division.y, `Duration (mins)` != 0) %&gt;% \n  select(Division = Division.x, everything(), -Division.y) %&gt;% \n  arrange(Division, desc(`Duration (mins)`))\n\nAgain, here’s an interactive table that you can use to explore the data. Note that it’s ordered by Division and then duration in minutes. I’ve hidden the code because it’s the same as for the table above.\n\n\nClick for the {DT} code\n\n\nnba_dur_div %&gt;% \n  datatable(\n    filter = \"top\",\n    extensions = c(\"Buttons\",\"Scroller\"),\n    rownames = FALSE,\n    class = \"compact\", width = \"100%\",\n    options = list(\n      dom = \"Blrtip\",\n      scroller = TRUE, scrollY = 300,\n      buttons = list(\"csv\")\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time we can see that there’s a maximum of 33 hours of driving required between two teams in the same division: Portland to Oklahoma City.\n\n\nA quick diversion: routing\nWe know from using osrm::osrmTable() that Miami to Portland has the longest travel duration. What’s the route?\nFortunately, {osrm} has the function osrmRoute() for fetching the routes between a pair of points.\nWe can grab a vector of coordinates for each team from our nba_table object and set these as our origin (src) and destination (dst) in osrm::osrmRoute(). The return object is a ‘linestring’ object that contains detail on the coordinates and coordinate system for the route.\n\n# Function to extract latlong vectors for teams\nget_ll &lt;- function(data, team_code) {\n  team_data &lt;- dplyr::filter(data, Code == team_code)\n  lng &lt;- pull(team_data, Longitude)\n  lat &lt;- pull(team_data, Latitude)\n  lnglat &lt;- c(lng, lat)\n  return(lnglat)\n}\n\n# Get route between latlong pairs\nroute &lt;- osrmRoute(\n  src = get_ll(nba_table, \"MIA\"),\n  dst = get_ll(nba_table, \"POR\"),\n  returnclass = \"sf\"\n)\n\nWarning: \"returnclass\" is deprecated.\n\nroute\n\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 4 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -122.6658 ymin: 25.78202 xmax: -80.15664 ymax: 45.8407\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n        src dst duration distance                       geometry\nsrc_dst src dst 3461.665 5247.537 LINESTRING (-80.18809 25.78...\n\n\nNow we can set up the same type of {leaflet} map as earlier, but we’ll include only Portland and OKC. I’ve hidden the map definition because it’s almost the same as before.\n\n\nClick for the {leaflet} map definition\n\n\nmia_por &lt;- nba_table %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(Code %in% c(\"MIA\", \"POR\"))\n\nmia_por_map &lt;- \n  leaflet(mia_por) %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLite) %&gt;%  # add basemap\n  addAwesomeMarkers(  # add markers\n    lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude,  # coordinates\n    popup = ~paste0(  # HTML content for popup info\n      \"&lt;b&gt;\", mia_por$Team, \"&lt;/b&gt;\",  # team name\n      \"&lt;br&gt;\", paste0(mia_por$Arena, \", \", mia_por$City),  # location\n      if_else(  # division/conference information\n        mia_por$Conference == \"Eastern\",\n        paste0(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color='#0000FF'&gt;\", mia_por$Division,\n               \" Division (Eastern Conference)&lt;/font&gt;\"),\n        paste0(\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;font color='#FF0000'&gt;\", mia_por$Division,\n               \" Division (Western Conference)&lt;/font&gt;\")\n      )\n    ),\n    icon = awesomeIcons(\n      library = \"ion\", icon = \"ion-ios-basketball\", # add basketball icon\n      markerColor = mia_por$colour_marker,  # colour the marker\n      iconColor = mia_por$colour_icon  # colour the basketball icon\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  addMeasure()  # add straight-line distance-measuring tool\n\n\nAnd to that map we can add the line that defines the route\n\nmia_por_map %&gt;% addPolylines(data = st_geometry(route))\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s a long way.\n\n\n\n4. Make a heatmap\nA quick way to visualise the data is to create a heatmap, where we take a matrix of teams in each division and colour by duration. Here, lighter colours indicate greater travel duration.\nThe plot is interactive; you can hover over squares in each facet to see specific information about that pair, including the exact duration value.\n\np &lt;- nba_dur_div %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(Start, End)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = `Duration (hrs)`)) +\n  xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\") + \n  facet_wrap(~Division, scales = \"free\")\n\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the light colours in the Northwest division where teams have to travel far (like the 33 hour trip from Portland and Oklahoma City), while travel durations in the Atlantic and Central divisions are shorter. Of course, the Clippers and Lakers both play in the Staples Center in LA, so their journey time is zero."

    "text": "Ending the journey\nSo, this post shows the the power of the {osrm} package for travel distance, duration and routing information.\nOf course, it’s never usually as simple as having your geographic data ready to go, so I hope this post also provides a good use-case for {rvest} to help you collect information and {tidyverse} for wrangling it.\nThe plots here are pretty minimal, but they hopefully give a flavour of how to use {leaflet} for plotting points and the routing between them according to {osrm}.\nThis post was initially written before the travel restrictions brought about by the 2020 pandemic. Of course, the maps would have been much simpler during for the 2020 playoffs, which all took place in a ‘bubble’ at Disney World, Florida."

It does what I need it to do for now, but no doubt there’s some refactoring to be done.\nThere’s a few things to note:\n\nI’m more comfortable handling R objects, so I converted early to a list with xml2::as_list(). Awkwardly, the data in the list object was stored as attributes to each element.\nThe distance data is stored in an element called ‘WorkoutStatistics’, but more than one element will have this name. We first have to isolate the element that is of the correct type, which has the name ‘HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDistanceWalkingRunning’.\nI converted the start and end variables to datetime class (POSIXct) and subtracted one from the other to get the duration of the run. This yields the ‘difftime’ class that can be converted to seconds with as.numeric() and the argument units = \"secs\".\nThere’s no input handling, because this was quick and for ‘fun’, lol."

Here’s the ‘run barcode’, with one vertical line per run (the darker it is the greater the distance):\n\nlibrary(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nrun_days &lt;- left_join(\n  data.frame(date = as_date(ymd(\"2020-03-23\"):ymd(\"2023-06-25\"))),\n  runs |&gt;\n    transmute(date = ymd(as_date(start)), km = distance_km, duration) |&gt;\n    filter(date &gt;= \"2020-03-23\" & date &lt;= \"2023-06-25\") |&gt;\n    group_by(date) |&gt; \n    summarise(km = sum(km), .groups = \"drop\"),\n  by = \"date\"\n) |&gt;\n  replace_na(list(run = 0))\n\npar(mar = rep(0, 4))\nimage(matrix(run_days$km), col = grey.colors(11, 0.8, 0))\nbox(col = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course, a simple distance over time plot:\n\nplot(\n  x = runs$start, \n  y = runs$distance_km, \n  las = 1,  # rotate y-axis labels\n  main = \"Runs captured with Nike Run Club in Apple Health\",\n  xlab = \"Date\",\n  ylab = \"Distance (km)\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nSome patterns are obvious. For example, there’s lots of 5 km runs until about mid-2021, when it hops to more like 7 km. That’s when I started running for 30 mins at a time, rather than for 5 km specifically.\nI’m pretty happy at 5 and 10 km, obviously, but maybe I should do more 21.1 km half-marathons. Or a full marathon? No no, that’s foolish: it would expand my y-axis too much and make it harder to observe patterns at shorter distances, amirite."

    "text": "Pivot\nWhy? The pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() functions replaced spread() and gather() in {tidyr} version 1.0.0.\nThese pairs of functions change the ‘shape’ of a data set from ‘wide’ to ‘long’ and vice versa.\nHere’s an example of wide data from the World Health Organisation:\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  country     `1999` `2000`\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan    745   2666\n2 Brazil       37737  80488\n3 China       212258 213766\n\n\nThere’s a row per country and a column per year of data. Each yearly column filled with a value. Note that these data aren’t ‘tidy’: the column headers are values, not variable names, and there isn’t a single observation per row. You have no way of knowing that the values in the columns are tuberculosis cases.\nThis data frame can be made more tidy by making it longer. Here’s what that looks like:\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  country      year  cases\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan  1999    745\n2 Afghanistan  2000   2666\n3 Brazil       1999  37737\n4 Brazil       2000  80488\n5 China        1999 212258\n6 China        2000 213766\n\n\nSo the year values from the headers have been put into their own column and the corresponding counts of tuberculosis are in a column with a more sensible name.\n{tidyr} helps you shift between these formats: pivot_wider() spreads long data into wide form and pivot_longer() gathers the wide data into long form. Why these names? Hadley did a poll to see how people referred to these two table shapes and ‘wider’ and ‘longer’ were most popular.3"

    "section": "Re-writing the episode",
    "text": "Re-writing the episode\nI started re-writing the episode, but turns out it wasn’t as simple as replacing spread() with pivot_longer() and gather() with pivot_wider(). For two reasons: different function arguments and slightly different outputs.\n\nArguments\nThe key and value arguments take the names of new columns to gather() into or spread(). People struggle with what these things mean. The pivot_*() functions make this a little easier: pivot_longer() has names_to and values_to, and pivot_wider() has names_from and values_from. The ‘to’ and ‘from’ suffixes make clearer what is happening.\nFor example, we can start with our wide-table example (built into the {tidyr} package as table4a) and turn it into the long-table example:\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nlong &lt;- pivot_longer(\n  data = table4a,  # wide data example \n  cols = c(`1999`, `2000`),  # the columns to be pivoted\n  names_to = \"year\",  # new column for the current column headers\n  values_to = \"cases\"  # new column for the corresponding values\n)\n\nprint(long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  country     year   cases\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan 1999     745\n2 Afghanistan 2000    2666\n3 Brazil      1999   37737\n4 Brazil      2000   80488\n5 China       1999  212258\n6 China       2000  213766\n\n\nAnd back:\n\nwide &lt;- pivot_wider(\n  data = long,  # dataset created above\n  names_from = year,  # create cols from data in this column\n  values_from = cases  # fill the new columns with data from this column\n)\n\nprint(wide)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  country     `1999` `2000`\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan    745   2666\n2 Brazil       37737  80488\n3 China       212258 213766\n\n\nIt was pretty straightforward to update the training materials with these function arguments, remembering that names_to needs to be supplied with a quoted string to become the name of the new column, for example, whereas names_from refers to an existing column and is a bare variable name.\n\n\nOutput changes\nI raised some things about outputs in my issue: (1) outputs from the new functions have tibble class even with a data.frame input and (2) might be ordered differently to outputs from the old functions. This required some changes to the images in the lesson, but didn’t change much else fundamentally."

I’ve made the twirdle() function to do this.3\ntwirdle() makes use of regular expressions and functions like regmatches() and regexpr() to extract:\n\nthe Wordle edition number, e.g. ‘206’\nthe attempts required, e.g. ‘4’, but also failures symbolised with ‘X’\nthe maximum allowed attempts (max), i.e. ‘6’\nwhether the user was playing in light or dark mode\nwhether the user was using colorblind mode\na string of characters representing the emoji grid, e.g. \"YG----G-GYGGGGG\", to symbolise a correct guess (i.e. a Green emoji), a correct letter but in the wrong place (i.e. Yellow), and a miss (-)\nthe tweet status_id so you can visit the original tweets\n\n\nCode\n\n\nClick for the full twirdle() function definition\n\n\ntwirdle &lt;- function(tweets) {\n  \n  g   &lt;- \"\\U1F7E9\"\n  o   &lt;- \"\\U1F7E7\"\n  y   &lt;- \"\\U1F7E8\"\n  blu &lt;- \"\\U1F7E6\"\n  bla &lt;- \"\\U2B1B\"\n  w   &lt;- \"\\U2B1C\"\n  \n  rx_all   &lt;- paste(g, o, y, blu, bla, w, sep = \"|\")\n  rx_right &lt;- paste(g, o, sep = \"|\")\n  rx_place &lt;- paste(y, blu, sep = \"|\")\n  rx_wrong &lt;- paste(bla, w, sep = \"|\")\n  rx_color &lt;- paste(o, blu, sep = \"|\")\n\n  tweets$meta &lt;- regexpr(\n    \"Wordle \\\\d{1,} [\\\\d{1}|X]/\\\\d{1}\",\n    tweets$text,\n    perl = TRUE\n  )\n  \n  tweets$meta &lt;- setNames(\n    tweets$meta, \n    ifelse(tweets$meta &lt; 0, FALSE, TRUE)\n  )\n  \n  tweets$meta &lt;- ifelse(\n    names(tweets$meta),\n    regmatches(tweets$text, tweets$meta),\n    NA_character_\n  )\n  \n  tweets &lt;- tweets[!is.na(tweets$meta), ]\n  \n  tweets$edition &lt;- as.numeric(\n    regmatches(\n      tweets$meta, \n      regexpr(\"\\\\d{1,}\", tweets$meta)\n    )\n  )\n  \n  tweets$attempts &lt;- regmatches(\n    tweets$meta,\n    regexpr(\"[\\\\d{1}|X](?=/)\", tweets$meta, perl = TRUE)\n  )\n  \n  tweets$attempts &lt;- ifelse(\n    tweets$attempts == \"X\",\n    NA_character_,\n    tweets$attempts\n  )\n  \n  tweets$attempts &lt;- as.numeric(tweets$attempts)\n  \n  tweets$allowed &lt;- as.numeric(\n    regmatches(\n      tweets$meta, \n      regexpr(\"(?&lt;=/)\\\\d{1}\", tweets$meta, perl = TRUE)\n    )\n  )\n  \n  tweets$grid &lt;- regmatches(\n    tweets$text, \n    gregexpr(rx_all, tweets$text) \n  )\n  \n  tweets$grid &lt;- lapply(\n    tweets$grid, \n    function(x) paste(x, collapse = \"\")\n  )\n  \n  tweets$colorblind &lt;- ifelse(\n    grepl(rx_color, tweets$grid), TRUE, FALSE\n  )\n  \n  tweets$mode &lt;- ifelse(\n    grepl(bla, tweets$grid), \"dark\",\n    ifelse(grepl(w, tweets$grid), \"light\", \"unknown\")\n  )\n  \n  tweets$grid &lt;- gsub(rx_right, \"G\", tweets$grid)\n  tweets$grid &lt;- gsub(rx_place, \"Y\", tweets$grid)\n  tweets$grid &lt;- gsub(rx_wrong, \"-\", tweets$grid)\n  \n  tweets[, c(\"edition\", \"attempts\", \"allowed\", \"mode\",\n             \"colorblind\", \"grid\", \"status_id\")]\n  \n}\n\n\nI also put the code for the function in a GitHub Gist.\n\n\nExample\nTo give an example of twirdle() in action, let’s first grab a small number of tweets using the {rtweet} package by Mike Kearney. I think it’s best to supply the query string of search_tweets() with the word ‘Wordle’ and at least one white or black emoji (signifying an incorrect letter).4\n\ntweets &lt;- rtweet::search_tweets(\n  q = \"Wordle \\U2B1B OR \\U2B1C\",\n  n = 10,  # return 10 tweets\n  include_rts = FALSE  # no retweets\n)\n\nAnd now we can pass the returned dataframe of tweets to twirdle(). It outputs a row per tweet, but there may be fewer tweets than we asked for because the content doesn’t conform to the output provided by Wordle. Sometimes people add their own comments into the results, disrupting the expected format. There’s also a Spanish version that has ‘(ES)’ in the meta information that we’re going to exclude for our purposes.\nNote that anyone who didn’t complete the puzzle in six tries gets a score of ‘X/6’, which is returned as NA_real_ in the attempts column.\n\ntwirdle(tweets)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 7\n  edition attempts allowed mode  colorblind grid                 status_id      \n    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;chr&gt;          \n1     213        5       6 light FALSE      GY--YGGG--GGG--GGG-… 14834445690229…\n2     213        3       6 dark  FALSE      Y-----YY--GGGGG      14834445680161…\n3     213        6       6 dark  FALSE      --Y-----YG-G--G--G-… 14834445678988…\n4     213        6       6 light FALSE      -----Y------Y-G-G--… 14834445674540…\n5     213       NA       6 light FALSE      ---Y---G-YGGG--GGG-… 14834445662083…\n6     213        5       6 dark  FALSE      -G------YYGGG--GGG-… 14834445661120…\n7     213        3       6 dark  FALSE      ----Y--GY--GG--GGG-… 14834445648075…\nYou could use this to do a number of things, like calculate the mean number of attempts for each day’s puzzle, look for guess patterns at scale, or maybe see whether dark-mode users are more skilled than light-mode users.\n\n\n\neldrow\nOf course, the whole purpose of sharing an encoded emoji grid is to prevent spoilers. No-one reading your result can see the answer or your guesses.\nBut, if you do know the answer, could you backwards-engineer prior guesses from the emoji grid?\nIntroducing eldrow(),5 which does exactly this with some help from mikefc’s {wordle} package for filtering from the Wordle wordlist.6\nYou pass to it the answer and the encoding of the last guess in the form \"Y-GY-\". As per the twirdle() output, the characters G, Y and - refer to a letter in the right place, wrong place, or not in the word. The function returns a vector of all the possible words given the guess and the answer.\nOne thing it doesn’t deal with is whether people are playing in ‘hard mode’, where ‘any revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses’. I think you could infer if someone was playing this way, but you could never be completely sure.\n\nCode\n\n\nClick for the full eldrow() definition\n\n\neldrow &lt;- function(guess, answer, words = wordle::wordle_dict){\n  \n  answer &lt;- tolower(answer)\n  guess &lt;- toupper(guess)\n  \n  guess_chars &lt;- strsplit(guess, \"\")[[1]]\n  answer_chars &lt;- strsplit(answer, \"\")[[1]]\n  \n  exact &lt;- ifelse(guess_chars == \"G\", answer_chars, \".\") |&gt;\n    paste0(collapse = \"\")\n  \n  wrong_spot &lt;- gsub(\n    \"\\\\.\", \"\", ifelse(guess_chars == \"Y\", answer_chars, \".\")\n  )\n  \n  exact_chars &lt;- regmatches(exact, gregexpr(\"\\\\w\", exact))[[1]]\n  correct_chars_table &lt;- table(\n    c(exact_chars, wrong_spot[wrong_spot != \"\"])\n  )\n  min_count &lt;- as.vector(correct_chars_table)\n  names(min_count) &lt;- names(correct_chars_table)\n  \n  possibles &lt;- wordle::filter_words(\n    words, exact, wrong_spot, min_count, min_count\n  )\n  \n  possibles &lt;- possibles[which(possibles != answer)]\n  possibles[order(possibles)]\n  \n}\n\n\nI also put the code for this in a GitHub Gist.\n\n\nExample\nSo, let’s say someone took three attempts at the word ‘shirt’7 and their first and second guesses gave encodings of \"YGG--\" then \"-GGG-\".\nWe can start by passing the answer and the encoding for the prior guess.\n\nguess_2 &lt;- eldrow(guess = \"-GGG-\", answer = \"shirt\")\nguess_2\n\n [1] \"chirk\" \"chirl\" \"chirm\" \"chiro\" \"chirp\" \"chirt\" \"chiru\" \"shire\" \"shirk\"\n[10] \"shirs\" \"third\" \"thirl\" \"whirl\" \"whirs\"\nOkay, so logicically they could have guessed any of these 14 options before their final, correct guess.\nNaturally, we can extrapolate one step further back and infer the earlier potential guesses.\nYou can iterate over these 14 possible words as the answer argument to eldrow(), setting the guess argument to the encoding for the previous attempt (i.e. \"YGG--\" was the first guess in our example).\n\nguesses_1_2 &lt;- lapply(\n  guess_2,\n  \\(x) eldrow(\"YGG--\", x)\n) |&gt; \n  lapply(\\(x) x[which(x != \"shirt\")]) |&gt;\n  setNames(guess_2)\n\nstr(guesses_1_2)\n\nList of 14\n $ chirk: chr \"thick\"\n $ chirl: chr \"thick\"\n $ chirm: chr \"thick\"\n $ chiro: chr \"thick\"\n $ chirp: chr \"thick\"\n $ chirt: chr \"thick\"\n $ chiru: chr \"thick\"\n $ shire: chr [1:22] \"chias\" \"chibs\" \"chics\" \"chiks\" ...\n $ shirk: chr [1:22] \"chias\" \"chibs\" \"chics\" \"chiks\" ...\n $ shirs: chr [1:22] \"chias\" \"chibs\" \"chics\" \"chiks\" ...\n $ third: chr [1:13] \"ahint\" \"chirt\" \"chits\" \"shift\" ...\n $ thirl: chr [1:13] \"ahint\" \"chirt\" \"chits\" \"shift\" ...\n $ whirl: chr(0) \n $ whirs: chr(0)\nThe output is a list with elements containing the potential first guesses and is named for each of the potential second guesses. So, logically, a possible set of guesses by this imaginary person was ‘shift’ then ‘third’ then ‘shirts’.\nOf course, you can eliminate any potential second guesses that failed to yield a potential first guess, like ‘whirl’ in this example.\nYou’ll also notice a number of the potential first guesses are the same word. The more they appear, the more likely that word is to have been the actual starting guess, I suppose?\n\nwords &lt;- c()\nfor (i in guesses_1_2) {\n  words &lt;- c(words, i)\n}\n\ncounts &lt;- as.data.frame(\n  table(words),\n  responseName = \"n\"\n)\ncounts$total &lt;- sum(counts$n)\ncounts$percent &lt;- round(100 * (counts$n / counts$total), 1)\n\nlikeliest &lt;- counts[order(-counts$percent), ]\nrownames(likeliest) &lt;- NULL\nhead(likeliest, 3)\n\n  words n total percent\n1 thick 7    99     7.1\n2 chits 5    99     5.1\n3 whist 5    99     5.1\nSo, purely on the basis of this frequency, ‘thick’ was most likely to be the first guess in this contrived example. You might want to consider how likely someone is to actually submit some of these words, given their obscurity.8"

    "text": "Clam-ouring for a package\nTransport for London (TfL) operates the travel system in London. To use their services you ‘tap in’ with an Oyster card.\nYou can sign up for monthly CSV files of your Oyster journey data, or you can sign in and download it from their website, but they’re not in a fully machine-readable state. Hence the {oystr} package.\nInstall and load with:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"oystr\")\nlibrary(oystr)\n\n{oystr} has two main functions:\n\noy_read() to read in CSV files from a folder and stitch them together\noy_clean() to wrangle the data into shape and engineer new columns\n\nThere’s two functions that deal with summarising the data, but are very much under development at time of writing:\n\noy_summary() to create a list of basic data summaries, like most visited stations\noy_lineplot() to create a simple plots of data over time\n\nThere’s also two example data sets:\n\njourneys_read is what a journey-history data set looks like when read in by oy_read()\njourneys_clean is what that read-in data set looks like when cleaned by oy_clean()\n\nThere’s also Oyster-related colours in oy_col().\nYou can read more on the {oystr} website, including a vignette, and find the source on GitHub.\n\nWinkle out the data\nThe oy_read() function is straightforward: basically, you supply a folder path and it finds the Oyster journey CSV files with the expected column names, reads them and binds them all together. That ends up looking like this:\n\nstr(journeys_read)\n\n'data.frame':   102 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ Date          : chr  \"31-Aug-2018\" \"31-Aug-2018\" \"28-Aug-2018\" \"28-Aug-2018\" ...\n $ Start.Time    : chr  \"16:11\" \"06:47\" \"18:57\" \"13:49\" ...\n $ End.Time      : chr  \"16:50\" \"07:34\" \"19:44\" \"14:43\" ...\n $ Journey.Action: chr  \"Station A to Station B\" \"Station B to Station A\" \"Station C to Station R\" \"Station R to Station L\" ...\n $ Charge        : chr  \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" ...\n $ Credit        : chr  \"NA\" \"NA\" \"NA\" \"NA\" ...\n $ Balance       : num  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 ...\n $ Note          : chr  \"NA\" \"NA\" \"NA\" \"NA\" ...\n\n\nBut this isn’t enough. The data files have several columns, like Date, Start time and Balance (see an anonymised example) that need sorting.\nThe oy_clean() function is the real MVP1. It does things like:\n\nenforce the datetime class where needed\nengineer an end date (some journeys ended a different day to when they started)\ncalculate journey duration\nextract mode of transport, start and end stations, bus routes, etc\n\nThat ends up looking like this:\n\nstr(journeys_clean)\n\n'data.frame':   102 obs. of  13 variables:\n $ datetime_start  : POSIXct, format: \"2018-08-31 16:11:00\" \"2018-08-31 06:47:00\" ...\n $ datetime_end    : POSIXct, format: \"2018-08-31 16:50:00\" \"2018-08-31 07:34:00\" ...\n $ weekday_start   : Ord.factor w/ 7 levels \"Monday\"&lt;\"Tuesday\"&lt;..: 5 5 2 2 7 7 7 7 6 6 ...\n $ journey_duration: 'difftime' num  39 47 47 54 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"units\")= chr \"mins\"\n $ mode            : chr  \"Train\" \"Train\" \"Train\" \"Train\" ...\n $ station_start   : chr  \"Station A\" \"Station B\" \"Station C\" \"Station R\" ...\n $ station_end     : chr  \"Station A\" \"Station B\" \"Station C\" \"Station R\" ...\n $ bus_route       : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ payment         : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ charge          : chr  \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" ...\n $ credit          : chr  \"NA\" \"NA\" \"NA\" \"NA\" ...\n $ balance         : num  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 ...\n $ note            : chr  \"NA\" \"NA\" \"NA\" \"NA\" ...\n\n\n\n\nLike it or limpet\nIt was tricky to deal with the Journey/Action column. It’s a bin for all sorts of things like:\n\nBus journey, route 87\nSt James's Park to Kings Cross [London Underground / National Rail]\"\nEntered and exited Pimlico\n[No touch-in] to Waterloo (platforms 1-11) [National Rail]\"\nSeason ticket added on touch in, Liverpool Street [National Rail]\nAutomated Refund, Southbury\nTopped up,\n\nIn fact, I don’t know all the possibilities for this column and TfL won’t tell me: I sent a help request and was told that this information isn’t available. I could do a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, but I can only get my own Oyster history. Which I already have.\nThis limits how useful this package can be for other people; I can’t handle formats for the Journey/Action column that I haven’t seen before. So I might as well write about where I’ve got to with {oystr} and encourage you to add to this list of possible formats I’ve started.\n\n\nBeing un-shellfish with dependencies\nAs an aside, I set myself a small challenge for {oystr}: to use only base R functions and avoid dependencies. These are packages that would have to be installed to make {oystr} work.\nWhy do this? In part because:\n\nI admire the philosophy of the tinyverse (‘lightweight is the right weight’)\nmy last package, {altcheckr}, was stuffed with dependencies\nI’ve been writing too much tidyverse code and want the sweet nostalgia hit of some classic base R code\nI’m a hero and I care about my users (me); you’re (I’m) welcome\n\nTo be more specific, I wanted to avoid required packages in the ‘Imports’ and ‘Remotes’ fields of the the DESCRIPTION file. Packages in the ‘Suggests’ field are fine; for example, {testthat} and {knitr} are required for development, but not by the user."

    "text": "Flexing the package’s mussels\nOkey dokey, so for about five years I’ve been collecting my Oyster data as monthly CSVs emailed to me by TfL, though some months are missing. I won’t be sharing these data, but here’s some quick examples of applying {oystr} to it.\n\n# Read all the CSV files from a folder path\ndata_read &lt;- oy_read(\"~/Desktop/oyster\")\n\nNext is oy_clean() to wrangle the data into shape.\n\n# Pass the data frame output from oy_read()\ndata_clean &lt;- oy_clean(data_read)\n\nAs a quick overview, there’s 1794 rows of data in the output, of which 97 per cent is train journeys. The earliest recorded journey start is 2014-09-01 07:32:00.\nWe can take this cleaned data and summarise it in various ways. For example, the oy_summary() function provides a list where each element is a basic summary.\n\ntrain_summ &lt;- oy_summary(data_clean, mode = \"Train\")\nnames(train_summ)  # list element names\n\n[1] \"count_journeys\"   \"stations_popular\" \"stations_matrix\"  \"duration_total\"  \n[5] \"day_popular\"\nSo for example, I can use train_summ$duration_total to find out that I’ve spent 76321 mins on TfL’s trains.\nThat’s 53 days.\nYou could also plot the data. Here’s a histogram coloured with Oyster-related colours from oy_cols().\n\npar(mar = c(4.5, 4.5, 5, 0))\n\nhist(\n  as.numeric(data_clean$journey_duration),\n  main = NULL, xlab = \"Journey duration (mins)\", \n  col = oy_cols(\"oyster_cyan\"), border = oy_cols(\"oyster_blue\"),\n  breaks = seq(0, 120, 5), las = 1\n)\n\ntitle &lt;- \"Matt Dray's journeys are 40 to 45 mins long, mostly\"\nsub &lt;- paste(\"Travelling sweatily via TfL trains since Autumn 2014\")\nmtext(side = 3, line = c(3, 2), adj = 0, cex = c(1.2, 1), c(title, sub))\n\n\nSo that’s my commute dominating the peak of that histogram. The two-hour journey went right across the network from Southbury in London’s north-west to Hounslow in the south-west. I assume the three-minute journey from South Kensington to Gloucester Road to avoid zombie-dinosaur attacks outside the Natural History Museum.\nObviously you could take the cleaned data and do some other neat stuff. Maybe I’ll do another post about this in future."

This is how we improve quality and build our community. And save money for the taxpayer.\nHandily, this is already expressed in the government’s Technology Code of Practice:\n\nShare, reuse and collaborate: avoid duplicating effort and unnecessary costs by collaborating across government and sharing and reusing technology, data, and services.\n\nI’ve had a small experience with this: I made the {a11ytables} R package to help producers of stats publications automate the creation of best-practice, accessible spreadsheets. It’s now being used in several organisations and is referenced from the government’s best-practice guidance.\nSuccess? Maybe. But also PANIK: I’ve left the organisation where I made it; I was the sole developer; I worry that I should have thought about this sooner; that I should fork and update it; that updating users will be hard; that links to the old package will break; and so on. Hopefully people will learn something from these missteps."

    "title": "An isometric dungeon chase in R",
    "section": "A new dimension",
    "text": "A new dimension\nMike (AKA mikefc, AKA coolbutuseless) is well known for off-label R creations that desecrate the assumption that ‘R is a language for statistical computing’.\nMike revealed the {isocubes} package recently, which lets you print objects made of isometric cubes to a graphics device. I immediately thought of the toy {r.oguelike} package I’ve been developing recently, which has the goal of creating (really) basic features of a roguelike game in R.1 The dungeons are currently ASCII tiles printed to the console. How would it look in isometric?\nIn a frenzied series of tweets, I built up a little toy that creates a procedural isometric dungeon and adds a user-controlled player character and a pathfinding enemy. The steps were to:\n\nBuild an isometric dungeon (tweet)\nAdd a player (tweet)\nAccept continuous input (tweet)\nAdd a pathfinding enemy (tweet)\n\nThis post talks through those steps. You can find the code for the final product in a GitHub Gist. It is absolutely not polished and really is just a Frankenstein’s monster of code that I stapled together.\n\n1. Build an isometric dungeon\n{r.oguelike} creates procedural dungeons in the form of a matrix where # symbols are non-traversable wall tiles and . indicates traversable floor tiles. I wrote about the inception of the package in a recent blog post.\nWe can swap the characters for height values, where the floor is 1 and the walls are 2, and {isocubes} will project the walls one cube above the plane of the floor. We can also use this information to provide colours; black for the floor and brown for the walls, for example, so it looks like a cavern.\nHere’s a few examples:\n\nI think that looks pretty good (ignore the graphical artefacts from the gif compression). I didn’t time how long it took for each image to be rendered because it was near-instantaneous.\nBut we don’t want to just look at pictures of dungeons, we want to explore them.\n\n\n2. Add a player\n{r.oguelike} lets a user move a character around the the floor tiles. The player is represented by @ in the dungeon matrix, which we can again substitute with a height value of 1 so it’s one cube higher than the floor. Of course, we should colour it to distinguish it from the walls; I chose blue.\nThe user’s keyboard input is accepted by readline() and this determines the character’s movement. Typing W then Enter will make the player move north one tile, for example. In {r.oguelike}, a keypress input causes the current location to be overwritten with a floor tile (.); the tile above to be replaced with the player symbol (@); and then the updated matrix is re-printed to the console.\nAgain, this all takes place inside the matrix that represents the dungeon, so we can also just lift this functionality into the {isocubes} version. Here you can see a series of user inputs to the console that result in the player moving around the floor tiles.\n\nIt was really pleasing when I got this to work, but it’s also quite tedious to tap in a key and hit enter for each movement.\n\n\n3. Accept continuous input\n{r.oguelike} simply prints the dungeon matrix to the console at the end of each turn, whereas our {isocubes} version takes place in a graphics window that’s refreshed with every turn.\nMike also has a package called {eventloop},2 which he suggested might be useful for continuous input from the user. The package contains:\n\na framework for rendering interactive graphics and handling mouse+keyboard events from the user at speeds fast enough to be considered interesting for games and other realtime applications\n\nBear in mind that it doesn’t work on Windows. Read more about it in Mike’s blog.\nHere you can see the result of incorporating {eventloop}. The user is pressing the arrow keys—which you can see being printed to the console—to move the player. This is way more seamless than the previous readline() method.\n\nThis is a nice demo, but it would be great to make this more of a ‘game’.\n\n\n4. Add a pathfinding enemy\n{r.oguelike} has an enemy character, represented in the dungeon matrix as E. Again, we can replace this with a height of 1 and colour it yellow, for example.\nI wrote recently about implementing simple breadth-first pathfinding so that the enemy can head toward wherever the player currently is. At time of writing I haven’t fully implemented the pathfinding into {r.oguelike}, but that didn’t stop me adding it into the code for this isometric demo.\nHere you can see the enemy cube (yellow) hunting down the player-controlled cube (blue). I was motivated to add a capture condition and decided to have fun with it.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the victory dance at the end of the gif (it was the best I could do with the limited graphics).3\n\n Note\nAfter this post was published, the {oblicubes} package was published by Trevor L Davies. It allows you to use oblique projections. So obviously I had a go with {r.oguelike}.\n\n\n\nClick for the required code changes.\n\nIn the code I wrote, you pretty much replace:\n\ncoords &lt;- isocubes::coords_heightmap(dungeon_h, col = dungeon_c)\n\ncubes  &lt;- isocubes::isocubesGrob(\n  coords,\n  max_y = ncol(dungeon_h) + 0.1 * ncol(dungeon_h),\n  fill = coords$col,\n  xo = 0.7\n)\n\ngrid::grid.newpage()  # 'clear'\ngrid::grid.draw(cubes)  # render\n\nWith:\n\ncoords &lt;- oblicubes::xyz_heightmap(\n  dungeon_h,\n  col = dungeon_c,\n  scale = 0.3,\n  ground = \"xy\"\n)\n\ngrid::grid.newpage()  # 'clear'\noblicubes::grid.oblicubes(coords)  # render"

Maybe the start_game() function could have an argument where the user can choose 2D or 3D (isometric or oblique) representations of the game.\nI also have a few ideas of how I can use my basic {r.oguelike} ‘engine’ with {isocubes} to develop some other, non-roguelike games. For example, Dmytro (AKA Deemah) suggested {rsokoban}. Sokoban is a game where you solve small tile-based puzzles by pushing crates onto designated spots. I was also reminded of Q*bert, where you try and touch all the floor tiles to change their colour.\nSo many ideas for off-label R use, so little time."

It also led to a later post on parameterised R Markdown reports, which I think is actually the better solution in most cases.\nI wouldn’t have known any of this without having a record of page views, but the method for collecting that data no longer grinds my goat."

    "text": "Demo: {drake} lays an egg\nI think there’s potential for {drake} in Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP): a wholly code-based method for producing the UK government’s statistical reports that improves reproducibility and automation, minimises errors and speeds-up production.\nI’ve made a very simple {drake} demo for an imaginary RAP project. The demo recreates a very small part of a statistical publication that tracks UK egg production1.\nThe demo code is on GitHub and the demo report has also been published to the web. Here’s a screenshot of the demo:\n\nBig shout-out to Duncan Garmonsway for the {govdown} package that recreates the style of GOV.UK—the website of the UK government—in R Markdown.\nThe rest of this post explains the steps in the demo:\n\nPrepare R scripts\nLoad the scripts\nVisualise\nMake the plan\nMake a change\n\n\n1. Prepare the scripts\nThe repo has three simple scripts2 containing the code for the analysis:\n\npackages.R loads the packages we need for our analysis with library()\nfunctions.R contains our own custom functions\negg-report.Rmd is the R Markdown report that will be output to HTML\nplan.R is where the steps of the analysis are written\n\nThe plan.R file needs a little more explanation. It contains the drake_plan() function, to which you pass each function required for the analysis. The functions can be in any order; {drake} works out the order from the dependencies between the scripts and outputs.\nThe demo plan is very simple, with only four functions wrapped inside drake_plan():\n\negg_plan &lt;- drake_plan(  # Create a drake_plan object called egg_plan\n  \n  # 1. Read the dataset\n  raw_data = read_ods(\n    path = \"data/eggs-packers-02may19a.ods\",\n    sheet = \"Packers_Annual\",\n    skip = 8\n  ),  # separate each function with a comma\n  \n  # 2. Prepare the data with a bespoke function\n  # from the functions.R file\n  data = clean_data(raw_data),\n  \n  # 3. Generate a plot using a bespoke function\n  # from the functions.R file\n  plot = create_plot(data),\n  \n  # 4. Finally, render the R Markdown report\n  # drake::knitr_in() marks the .Rmd file as a dependency\n  # drake::file_out() marks the .HTML as an output\n  report = rmarkdown::render(\n    knitr_in(\"egg-report.Rmd\"),\n    output_file = file_out(\"docs/egg-report.html\"),\n    quiet = TRUE\n  )\n\n)\n\n\n\n2. Load the scripts\nThe data and code are all in place. How do we run the analysis?\nEverything we need is stored in a small file called make.R. It starts by calling source() for each R script:\n\nsource(packages.R)   # load the packages\nsource(functions.R)  # load the bespoke functions\nsource(plan.R)       # load the plan\n\nSourcing the plan file results in the drake_plan() function being run. The output is a special drake_plan data frame object, which is called egg_plan in our demo. It has columns called ‘target’ and ‘command’ and a row for each function in our analysis:\n\negg_plan\n\n# A tibble: 4 x 2\n  target   command                                                                           \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;expr&gt;                                                                            \n1 raw_data read_ods(path = \"data/eggs-packers-02may19a.ods\", sheet = \"Packers_Annual\",      …\n2 data     clean_data(raw_data)                                                             …\n3 plot     create_plot(data)                                                                …\n4 report   render(knitr_in(\"egg-report.Rmd\"), output_file = file_out(\"docs/egg-report.html\")…\nThe plan object acts like an instruction booklet, which can be read ‘to each target (data and outputs), apply the named command (the functions of the analysis)’. So the contents of the egg_plan data frame can be read\n\nRead the raw data (the target) with readODS::read_ods() (the command)\nClean the data (target) with the custom clean_data() function (command)\nPlot the data (target) with the custom plot_data() function (command)\nCreate an R Markdown report (target) with rmarkdown::render() (command)\n\nSo we have the instructions stored in an object. Now we can (optionally) produce a dependency graph of these targets to get an idea of the relationships between the elements of the analysis.\n\n\n3. Visualise\nThe first step to create the visual is to extract information about the egg_plan in a configuration (‘config’) list object. One element of the config is, for example, an igraph object that helps construct graphs from your workflow. The function to get this is drake_config().\n\negg_config &lt;- drake_config(egg_plan)\n\nA number of {drake} functions can take the config object and do something with the information inside it. In our case, we’re going to pass the config to vis_drake_graph(), which builds an interactive dependency graph using {visNetwork}.\n\nvis_drake_graph(egg_config)\n\nThis generates an interactive output (see it here). Here’s a screenshot:\n\nThe visualisation is shape-coded by target type (e.g. functions are triangles) and colour-coded to show whether everything is up-to-date (e.g. green if it is). Arrows show the file dependencies (e.g. both the clean_data function and raw_data file come together to produce the data object).\n\n\n4. Make the plan\nHaving satisfied yourself that the plan looks correct, running the plan is as simple as:\n\nmake(egg_plan)\n\nThis executes all the instructions laid out in the egg_plan object and our HTML report pops out at the end.\nOf course, re-running the plan straight away again does… nothing. No code needs to be re-executed if nothing’s changed!\n\nSide note: the cache\nTurns out that {drake} is storing all the intermediate objects that were created when making your plan. They’re cached in a hidden .drake/ folder so they can be retrieved without needing to be re-created.\nThis means you can use the .drake/ cache to supply objects to an R Markdown file, which is achieved by either readd()ing or loadd()ing them. For example, the plot in the demo R Markdown file was called with loadd(plot).\n\n\n\n5. Make a change\nIf anything changes in our data or code then the downstream targets will be out of sync. Let’s pretend we’ve changed a line of code in the create_plot() function, which could be something is superficial as altering its title. What do you think will happen?\nWell, {drake} knows there’s been a change. You can check this by running source(\"R/functions.R\") in make.R again and then run outdated(egg_config). This prints the name of the altered file plus the other files impacted by it.\nWe can see this by recreating the dependency graph (see it here): the plot target is outdated, as are the targets downstream that depend on it (report and the egg-report.html file). This is indicated by them being coloured black. Here’s a static version:\n\nSo now we can see the real power of {drake}, as re-running the plan now will regenerate only the outdated files."

It was tedious.\nThere are, however, a couple of options in R to take an image and extract the pixels from it: see Florian Privé’s Shiny app in the {pixelart} package and Mike Cheng’s (AKA coolbutuseless) blog post that also describes how to animate them.1\nBut what if you want to create a sprite from scratch? It would be great if you could click pixels interactively and be returned a matrix encoding your image.\nI couldn’t find an R package to do this, so I decided to make a very simple one: {pixeltrix} (as in ‘pixel’ and ‘matrix’, but also as in ‘tricks’2, lol).\nIt’s written entirely in base R (no Shiny or server needed) and can be run in the R console. It’s basically a repeat loop that runs image() to plot squares3 (hereafter ‘pixels’) and locator()4 to let you click those pixels on and off. The coordinates of each click are matched to the nearest pixel centre, the pixel’s value is incremented by 1 (or wrapped back to zero) and the image is redrawn.\nThe package is still in development, but I think it’s reached a useable state for my own purposes.\n\nℹ️ Update\nI lied. The package has been updated since this post. You can read about the changes in a more recent blogpost. Highlight: you can make animations now."

Repeatedly click a pixel to cycle it through the number of states you asked for. For example, n_states = 4 means you cycle it through values of 0, 1, 2 and 3 (wrapping back to 0), which will be manifested in the plot as different shades of grey.\nNote that you can only click one pixel at a time, so you’ll have to do a lot of clicking if your n_states value is high. Colouring stuff in really slowly is called ‘mindfulness’, I believe; good for your wellbeing.\nWhen you’re done, you press the Esc key, or the ‘Finish’ button in the plot window of RStudio. I saved all the images below via the ‘Export’ button in RStudio.\n\nYou’re returned a matrix that contains the value of each pixel in your image. So if you had set n_states = 3, a twice-clicked pixel gets the value 2, an unclicked pixel defaults to a value of 0, etc.\n\nx\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    0    1\n[2,]    0    1    0\n[3,]    1    0    1\nThis matrix is basically a blueprint of the image you created. You can take this and do other things with it. Maybe you’ll make art by passing it to ggplot() to match each of the pixel-state values to a colour. Maybe you’ll use it to plan your crochet or cross-stitch5, or to teach spatial epidemiology (!).\nIf you want to edit your matrix, you can pass it into edit_pixels(). This means you don’t have to start over from scratch with click_pixels() if you only want to change something small. Note that you can provide a higher n_states value to edit_pixels() than the current maximum in the matrix you provided."

In short, each piece is square and contains patterns of colourful concentric lines that are arranged into panels of varying shapes with black borders.\nRather than recreate his artworks exactly, I decided to riff on the approach with a (very basic) Shiny app, which adds different types of lines and some randomisation.\nYou can access it by clicking this button (until I take it down1): \nAlternatively, download and launch it locally via an R session:\n\nshiny::runGitHub(\n  \"viz-recreation\", \"matt-dray\", \"main\",\n  \"2021-07-01_rt_lewitt/lewitt-remix-app\"\n)\n\nOr you can go to the app’s source on GitHub.\nIn the app, you can change a few parameters and then hit the ‘Generate’ button for a new variant, which can be downloaded to your computer. I’ve limited the inputs so that you get relatively ‘sensible’ outputs (whatever that means).\nYou could create something that looks similar to LeWitt’s original, or go off-piste and create a much larger number of panels or much thicker lines. Have fun!\nRead on for an explanation and for some examples."

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nOnce again, I’ve used only base R functions to generate the outputs, just like my previous #RecreationThursday attempt. I have nothing against other tools, I just don’t care much for dependencies.\n\nThe trick\nI’ve used a cunning shortcut to mimic LeWitt: rather than draw any lines or shapes, I’ve just over-plotted points of decreasing size and variable colour with R’s built-in plotting characters. For example, 21 is a filled circle, 22 a square and so on. Here’s the shapes I used:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen several of these plotting points are stacked on the same origin, it gives the effect of concentric lines. Here’s an example of plotting 50 unfilled circles of decreasing size on the same point:\n\n# Set variables\nshape &lt;- 21  # plotting character\nshp_n &lt;- 50  # number of points to plot\nshp_x &lt;- 2   # point size multiplier ('thickness')\npal   &lt;- rainbow(5)  # colours\n\n# Set margins to zero, see only the plot\npar(mar = rep(0, 4))\n\n# Plot concentric circles\nplot(\n  x    = rep(0, shp_n),\n  y    = rep(0, shp_n),\n  axes = FALSE,\n  pch  = shape,\n  cex  = shp_x * shp_n:1,\n  col  = pal\n)\n\n\n\n\nIf these circles are filled from largest to smallest, it will give the impression that lines have been created, when really it is a stack of points. I’ve added in a ‘multiplier’ variable that increases the gap from the edge of one point to the edge of the next smallest. The larger that variable, the large the gap, which in the output makes it look like the ‘lines’ are thicker.\n\n\nFunctions\nThere are two custom functions in the app: one function uses this point-stacking principle to generate a single-panel LeWitt remix and the other function calls multiple of these panels into a square grid.2\nThe arguments include the plotting character (circle, diamond, etc), the origin position that the centre of the point-stack will take (named for cardinal directions, like NE to place the origin in the top-right), the colours, the number of shapes to overplot (you want enough to completely cover the plot surface), the apparent ‘thickness’ of the ‘lines’ in the output, and the width of the box3 that surrounds the image.\n\n\nFunction demos\nSo here’s a demo of the function4 that generates a single panel. It uses uses the triangle plotting characters, which originate in the centre and alternate through rainbow colours. This is not too dissimilar from LeWitt’s originals.\n\n# Grab the functions from the repo\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/viz-recreation/main/2021-07-01_rt_lewitt/lewitt-remix-app/global.R\")\n\n# Demo: plot a single panel\njust_lewitt(\n  shape = 24,          # triangle plotting character\n  place = \"C\",         # 'centre'\n  pal   = rainbow(7),  # colours\n  shp_n = 200,         # number of points to plot\n  shp_x = 4,           # 'line thickness'\n  box_w = 20           # outer box thickness\n)\n\n\n\n\nAnd below is a panel made of four calls to the single-panel function. Elements like shape and the placement of the origin point are randomised.\nAlso, rather than use LeWitt’s colouring scheme, I decided to randomise the colour palette by sampling seven colours from R’s built-in named colours(). This can produce some pretty garish results, but also some quite pleasing ones too. (I’m colourblind, so your mileage may vary.)\n\n# Set a seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(5)\n\n# Set up a colour palette\nmy_pal &lt;- sample(colours(), 7)\n\n# Demo: plot a grid of randomised panels\njust_lewitt2(\n  dimn  = 2,       # x and y dimensions of grid\n  pal   = my_pal,  # colour palette\n  shp_x = 4,       # 'line thickness'\n  box_w = 10       # outer box thickness\n)\n\n\n\n\nThis can end up looking like an eye-popping Magic Eye puzzle.\n\nset.seed(7)\njust_lewitt2(\n  dimn  = 10,\n  pal   = sample(colours(), 7),\n  shp_x = 1,\n  box_w = 0\n)\n\n\n\n\nOr a bit like semaphore.\n\nset.seed(7)\njust_lewitt2(\n  dimn  = 2,\n  pal   = sample(colours(), 7),\n  shp_x = 20,\n  box_w = 0\n)\n\n\n\n\nOr whatever this is.\n\nset.seed(2)\njust_lewitt2(\n  dimn  = 10,\n  pal   = sample(colours(), 7),\n  shp_x = 1,\n  box_w = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\nUh-oh, I think I may have slipped through space-time.\n\nset.seed(11)\njust_lewitt2(\n  dimn  = 2,\n  pal   = sample(colours(), 7),\n  shp_x = 0.4,\n  box_w = 0\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe Shiny app basically fills these function arguments with your inputs, providing some randomness with a new seed that’s generated with each click of the ‘Generate’ button or if you move any of the sliders.\nYou can control the number of panels in the grid, the ‘thickness’ of the lines (which, remember, is just the relative gap between the overlapping plot points) and the thickness of the border (I could have made this value respond to other inputs, but I particularly like ignoring ‘balance’ and choosing extremely thick borders, or none at all).5\nI would love it if you tried out the app, used the ‘Download’ button to save a PNG copy6, and then showed me on Twitter."

I’ve kept to a grid for simplicity.↩︎\nBoxes are drawn on a panel-by-panel basis, so the ‘interior’ borders appear thicker because of the additive effect of surrounding boxes.↩︎\nThese are named like just_lewitt() because I like to start functions with verbs and thought it sounded a bit like a certain brand slogan.↩︎\nNote that there are no inputs for each panel’s plotting-point shape, nor the centre of origin within the panel (top-left, bottom-right, etc), nor the colours.

Each tweet always ends in a single, summary word that makes me cringe.\nWait, what? Let’s take a look at their most recent tweet at time of writing:\n\n14 - Harry Kane has scored 14 goals in his last 14 appearances in the FA Cup, averaging a goal every 63 minutes in the competition in this period. Guarantee.\n\n‘Guarantee’. Gah.\nOr this tweet:\n\n16 - Since his first appearance in the competition in January 2016, Leicester’s Kelechi Iheanacho has scored more FA Cup goals than any other player (16). Specialist.\n\n‘Specialist’. Sigh.\nA completely small and pointless thing to be annoyed by, right?\nBut here’s the scenario. Over the yuletide period (on Christmas day!) they ran this tweet:\n\n1 - Stiliyan Petrov (@StanPetrov19) is the only player to have played in the Premier League whose name contains all the letters in the word ‘Nativity’. Star.\n\nObviously, I have absolutely nothing against ‘Big Stan’. He’s a legend; a ‘star’, if you will. Captain of Aston Villa! Bulgaria! Battled leukaemia and still made it to nearly 600 games. One of the best Bulgarian/Premier League ‘Petrovs’, along with cult legend Martin.\nBut could this stat possibly be true? Surely there’s at least one other player. Perhaps a window of opportunity for me to avenge my feelings of cringe?\nOh, and obviously you can ignore the candid dismissals in the tweet’s replies, for example:\n\nWhat are we supposed to do with this information?

So, aha, you cannot escape, Opta!\nMy little {soccercolleagues} package that I wrote about in early 2022 is built heavily (heavily!) around {worldfootballR} and has a convenience function we can use.\nThe niche2 primary objective of {soccercolleagues} is to let you find pairs of football players that were colleagues at some point. Like: ‘which current Premier League footballer has been team mates with each of the following: Kevin Phillips, Mark Viduka, Dejan Lovren, Danny Ings and Nicky Butt?’3\nFollow along. As ever, you can install the {soccercolleagues} package from GitHub:\n\nif(!require(remotes)) install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/soccercolleagues\")\n\nWe’ll also use the {tidyverse} for wrangling.\n\nlibrary(soccercolleagues)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nSo we can ask Transfermarkt for all the years of the English Premier League, which began in 1992:\n\n# This will take quite a long time...\nepl_players &lt;- soccercolleagues::get_players(\n  seasons = 1992:2022,\n  country = \"England\"\n)\n\nAnd now we can look for the players whose names contain the letters in ‘nativity’:\n\nepl_players |&gt;\n  distinct(player_name) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    player_name = str_remove_all(tolower(player_name), \" \"),\n    n_count = str_count(player_name, \"n\"),\n    a_count = str_count(player_name, \"a\"),\n    t_count = str_count(player_name, \"t\"),\n    i_count = str_count(player_name, \"i\"),\n    v_count = str_count(player_name, \"v\"),\n    y_count = str_count(player_name, \"y\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    n_count &gt;= 1 &\n      a_count &gt;= 1 &\n      t_count &gt;= 2 &\n      i_count &gt;= 2 &\n      v_count &gt;= 1 &\n      y_count &gt;= 1\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  player_name    n_count a_count t_count i_count v_count y_count\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1 stiliyanpetrov       1       1       2       2       1       1\nOof… they were right.

But I’ve got my eye on you! You’ll slip up one day!\n…But wait. Opta were misnaming Stan as ‘Stylian Petrov’ in tweets as late as 2012. Get rekt!

You can copy a whole repo as many times as you like, unlike forks.\nFollowing a template can help keep your work organised and encourage consistency within and between projects. I can see this being useful for sharing optimal workflows across boundaries like government departments."

The create_analysis_project() function sets up a project folder for you with various arguments to add certain folders and setup things like dependency management, git and continuous integration.\nAnother option is to set up your analysis as a package, as outlined by Thomas J Leeper, for example. Jenny Bryan and Hadley Wickham’s {usethis} package provides lots of functions to help you create a package and add things to it, like create_project() and use_git().\nI like these two options more than the template, to be honest. The template is really for quick, simple analysis; mostly for my own purposes."

The code below produces plots for run distances by date (top left), cumulative distance by date (bottom left), and a histogram of run distances in 1 km bins (right).\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(workouts_out) + \n  geom_point(aes(date, km), shape = 1) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Distance (km)\") +\n  theme_light()\n\np2 &lt;- workouts_out %&gt;% \n  mutate(km_cum = cumsum(km)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(date, km_cum)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Cumulative distance (km)\") +\n  theme_light()\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(workouts_out) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(km), binwidth = 1) +\n  labs(x = \"Distance (1 km bins)\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_light()\n\nlibrary(patchwork)  # easy plot layouts\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nYou can see I started with a lot of 5 km runs in April and May 2020, before branching out to 10 km or more. I’ve been pretty consistent in running every two or three days and that’s reflected in the chart of cumulative distance. The histogram shows that most runs have been just above 5 km, with another peak just above 10 km. That makes sense: I intentionally set out to run at least these distances.\nAnother idea is that you you could use the {calendR} package to plot a calendar of your activity.5 Or you could do something more abstract: here’s a ‘run barcode’ with a line per run for the full year. The darker the line, the further the distance travelled.\n\nrun_days &lt;- left_join(\n  tibble(date = as_date(ymd(\"2020-03-23\"):ymd(\"2021-03-22\"))),\n  workouts_out %&gt;% \n    filter(date &gt;= \"2020-03-23\" & date &lt; \"2021-03-23\") %&gt;%\n    group_by(date) %&gt;% summarise(km = sum(km), .groups = \"drop\"),\n  by = \"date\"\n) %&gt;% replace_na(list(run = 0))\n\npar(mar = rep(0, 4))\nimage(matrix(run_days$km), col = grey.colors(11, 0.8, 0))\nbox(col = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\nA few things stick out to me when scanning this barcode. The three black bands are the half-marathons; the white space (i.e. no runs) after the first of these indicates the rest my knees needed afterwards. There’s a thick grey band after halfway, which is when I tried to run seven days in a row (the app is gamified and you get a special badge for doing that). You can also see how the pattern was more regular at the start, but I’ve since settled into a routine of just trying to fit in three runs and about 25 km per week."

I’ve only done a basic exploration of the data, but there’s so much more you could do.\nAfter starting this post, I noticed that Mark Koester has written an in-depth post about Apple Health data, with a focus on Python code for achieving a similar goal. It notes third-party tools like QS Access for extracting data into a friendlier CSV format, for example.\nIt’ll be interesting to revisit this in another year’s time to see how a ‘return to normality’ (whatever that means) might impact these patterns of activity."

Basically, it will predict the next word from the current one based on the likelihood from our input data set. You can read more about this principle elsewhere.\nThe {markovifyR} package is a wrapper for the Python package markovify, which ‘is a simple, extensible Markov chain generator’. You can install markovify at the command line via R’s system() function, then install {markovifyR} from GitHub and {furrr} from CRAN.\n\n# system(\"pip3 install markovify\")\nlibrary(markovifyR)  # remotes::install_github(\"abresler/markovifyR\")\nlibrary(furrr)  # install.packages(\"furrr\")\n\nNow we can generate the model given all the lyrics.\n\nmarkov_model &lt;- generate_markovify_model(\n    input_text = goat_lyrics,\n    markov_state_size = 2L,\n    max_overlap_total = 25,\n    max_overlap_ratio = 0.7\n  )\n\nYou can meddle with these controls, but I’ve kept to the suggested defaults for now. Note that ‘overlap’ relates to the likelihood of generating whole sentences that already exist. See markovify for more detail.\n\nGenerate lines\nUse the markovify_text() function with our markov_model object to generate single lines.\nFans of the Mountain Goats will no doubt recognise some of the phrases from existing songs.\n\ngoat_speak &lt;- markovify_text(\n  markov_model = markov_model,\n  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,\n  output_column_name = 'goat_speak',\n  count = 5,\n  tries = 100,\n  only_distinct = TRUE,\n  return_message = TRUE\n)\n\ngoat_speak: Like a trashcan fire in a folding chair\ngoat_speak: Darkness climbing up the variables\ngoat_speak: And when the rain on our tongues\ngoat_speak: Wear black back to where I go, do what you said that you make\ngoat_speak: I know you're leaving too\n\n\nI ran this function a few times and here a few outputs that made me laugh (or think):\n\nBut I felt all the Portuguese water dogs?\nI write reminders on my kimono that I could not remember\nLeann Rimes on the ocean\nSunset spilling through your megaphone\nIt’s the most gorgeous cow I’d ever wanted\nI hope I never liked Morrissey\nWent and got the case of vodka from a disco in old east Berlin\nFresh coffee at sunrise, warm my lips like a dying man\nBut my love is like a tattoo into my ear\nAnd you brought me a bowl of cooked wild grasses\nWe had hot caramel sticking to her skin\nAnd then the special chicken\nAnd a bird we would have liked brought the Norman invasion\nHow come there’s peacocks in the face of the rainbow\n\n\n\nGenerate a verse\nYou can also choose to seed the first word in the sentence. You can do this in such a way that you can create a sort-of possible-sounding stanza.\n\ngoat_speak &lt;- markovify_text(\n  markov_model = markov_model,\n  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,\n  output_column_name = 'goat_lyric',\n  start_words = c(\"I\", \"And\", \"But\", \"So\"),\n  count = 1,\n  tries = 100,\n  only_distinct = TRUE,\n  return_message = TRUE\n)\n\ngoat_lyric: I was sure my heart and I should have said something evil and then orange then opting for secession\ngoat_lyric: And I will walk down to the main square\ngoat_lyric: But I knew you were knocking\ngoat_lyric: So you can breathe now\n\n\n…or not.\nI think John Darnielle probably remains the best generator of Mountain Goats lyrics for now."

They’re pretty ubiquitous for scrolling horizontally through images on websites. {slickR} provides a neat way of embedding these in R Markdown documents and Shiny apps. Plus, the elements in the carousel can be basically anything (iframes, plots, etc), not just images."

These are probably best viewed on a desktop machine.\nIn fact, it’s three carousels that are stacked and synchronised: one with the front sprite, one with the back sprite and one that shows the number and name of the Pokémon. Click a sprite to go to the relevant page on Bulbapedia, the Pokémon wiki.\nI’ve also set each page to display three ’mon at a time and that each page will advance by three. This is so that I can display one Pokémon evolutionary chain per page, since the max chain length is three (e.g. Bulbasaur &gt; Ivysaur &gt; Venusaur). I added a blank spacer pad where a chain was shorter than three (e.g. Rattata &gt; Raticate &gt; BLANK, or Farfetch’d &gt; BLANK &gt; BLANK).\nThe pages auto-advance in the demo above, but can be advanced manually in the standalone version by clicking the directional arrows, or by using your arrow keys if the widget has been selected.\nIt’s also possible to jump to a specific evolutionary chain by using the page ‘dots’ underneath the carousel. Here, you can click one of the tiny sprites to jump to the page that contains the evolutionary chain that starts with that Pokémon."

The code for the full carousel demo is available from the matt-dray/pkmn_slickr repo.\nAgain, do check out the really helpful NBA example on the {slickR} website for more examples.\n\nOne carousel\nHere’s an example of the code for an individual carousel that displays just the front-facing sprite:\n\nfront_carousel &lt;- slickR(\n  obj = pkmn2$sprite_front_src,\n  objLinks = pkmn2$url,\n  height = 200, width = \"100%\"\n) +\n  settings(\n    autoplay = TRUE, arrows = FALSE,\n    slidesToShow = 3, slidesToScroll = 3\n  )\n\nBasically, You call the slickR() function with arguments that define the object to display and also things like links (objLinks) and the size of the elements. Here, pkmn2$sprite_front_src is a vector of sprite image sources, for example.\nYou can then tweak the look and behaviour by adding settings() with a + (like {ggplot2}). Here, autoplay advances the slides automatically; arrows dictates whether to show manually-clickable advancement buttons; and slidesToShow and slidesToScroll control the number of elements seen on one ‘page’ of elements and how many elements to advance by.\n\n\nSynced sandwich\nI created two more of these {slickR} objects for the back sprite and the Pokémon name and number, with slight differences compared to the code above.\nI then sandwiched all three together like this:\n\ncarousel &lt;-\n  front_carousel %synch%\n  back_carousel %synch%\n  names_carousel \n\nThe %synch% operator makes sure that advancing any of the carousels advances them all together.\n\n\nSprite dots\nThe third of the three carousels, the names_carousel has the argument dots = TRUE in its settings. This makes dots appear under the carousel to show which ‘page’ the carousel is currently displaying. You can also click these dots to jump to a given page.\nYou can change these dots to other things, like numeric values. I was able to use the guidance to replace the dots with sprites. This means you can click a mini sprite under the carousel to jump to the page where that Pokémon starts an evolutionary chain."

There’s a popular idea of there being six degrees of separation.\nInstead of separation between any two people, we can measure separation from one fixed person. For example, we can calculate a Bacon Number for actors connected to Kevin Bacon, ‘centre of the entertainment universe’.\nIt works like this: you have a Bacon Number of zero if you are Kevin Bacon (hi Kevin, thanks for reading my blog). You have a Bacon Number of one if you were in a film with him. Your number is two if you were in a film with someone who was in a film with Kevin Bacon.\nA more classic example is the Erdős Number, which expresses the separation of mathematicians from the prolific Paul Erdős via published academic papers. And yes, there’s an Erdős-Bacon Number for actor-mathematicians.1\nWe can extend this approach to any network. One nerdy example is shared authorship on packages published on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), the go-to repository for packages for the R programming language. {kevinbacran} can help you do this."

Beware: this could take several minutes.\n\nepl_players &lt;- get_players(\n  seasons = 1992:2020,\n  country = \"England\"\n)\n\nglimpse(epl_players)\n\nRows: 20,643\nColumns: 11\n$ player_name    &lt;chr&gt; \"Paul Gerrard\", \"Jon Hallworth\", \"John Keeley\", \"Ian Gray\", \"Craig…\n$ player_pos     &lt;chr&gt; \"Goalkeeper\", \"Goalkeeper\", \"Goalkeeper\", \"Goalkeeper\", \"Centre-Ba…\n$ player_age     &lt;dbl&gt; 19, 26, 30, 17, 20, 19, 19, 40, 29, 26, 27, 24, 26, 26, 26, 25, 26…\n$ nationality    &lt;chr&gt; \"England\", \"England\", \"England\", \"England\", \"England\", \"England\", …\n$ in_squad       &lt;dbl&gt; 27, 16, 29, 12, 35, 1, 35, 1, 40, 9, 33, 36, 41, 37, 6, 42, 15, 32…\n$ appearances    &lt;dbl&gt; 25, 16, 1, 0, 24, 0, 33, 0, 40, 5, 33, 31, 41, 32, 6, 42, 14, 32, …\n$ goals          &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 9, 0, 3, 3, 6, 0, 3, 3, 2, …\n$ minutes_played &lt;dbl&gt; 2250, 1440, 90, 0, 2114, 0, 2953, 0, 3600, 341, 2799, 2522, 3647, …\n$ team_url       &lt;chr&gt; \"https://www.transfermarkt.com/oldham-athletic/startseite/verein/1…\n$ team_name      &lt;chr&gt; \"oldham-athletic\", \"oldham-athletic\", \"oldham-athletic\", \"oldham-a…\n$ season         &lt;chr&gt; \"1992\", \"1992\", \"1992\", \"1992\", \"1992\", \"1992\", \"1992\", \"1992\", \"1…\nA dataframe is returned with lots of handy stuff like the player name, team name, season and a bunch of player data. Obviously you could take this data away and do whatever you like with it, it’s quite a neat dataset for other, less esoteric analysis of the history of the Premier League.\n\n\n2. Find team mates\nNow to filter this information for a given focus player or players.\nYou provide the dataframe output of get_players() to get_colleagues() as the all_players() argument, along with a vector of players names. The function filters the dataframe down to just the team mates of the selected player or players for the teams and seasons in which they played together.\n\nteammates &lt;- get_colleagues(\n  all_players = epl_players,\n  players = c(\"Kolo Touré\", \"Yaya Touré\")\n)\n\nRows: 348\nColumns: 12\n$ focus_name     &lt;chr&gt; \"Kolo Touré\", \"Kolo Touré\", \"Kolo Touré\", \"Kolo Touré\", \"Kolo Tour…\n$ player_name    &lt;chr&gt; \"Stuart Taylor\", \"Richard Wright\", \"Patrick Vieira\", \"Stuart Taylo…\n$ player_pos     &lt;chr&gt; \"Goalkeeper\", \"Goalkeeper\", \"Defensive Midfield\", \"Goalkeeper\", \"D…\n$ player_age     &lt;dbl&gt; 20, 23, 25, 21, 26, 22, 17, 27, 23, 18, 28, 19, 21, 20, 22, 21, 24…\n$ nationality    &lt;chr&gt; \"England\", \"England\", \"France\", \"England\", \"France\", \"England\", \"F…\n$ in_squad       &lt;dbl&gt; 21, 43, 54, 20, 42, 4, 31, 44, 7, 26, 44, 14, 13, 40, 45, 50, 41, …\n$ appearances    &lt;dbl&gt; 15, 22, 54, 13, 42, 0, 22, 44, 0, 24, 44, 11, 13, 40, 44, 49, 40, …\n$ goals          &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 12, 0, 1, 30, 1, 0, 7, 1…\n$ minutes_played &lt;dbl&gt; 1220, 1929, 4702, 1081, 3563, 0, 1347, 3822, 0, 1456, 3926, 728, 1…\n$ team_url       &lt;chr&gt; \"https://www.transfermarkt.com/fc-arsenal/startseite/verein/11/sai…\n$ team_name      &lt;chr&gt; \"fc-arsenal\", \"fc-arsenal\", \"fc-arsenal\", \"fc-arsenal\", \"fc-arsena…\n$ season         &lt;chr&gt; \"2001\", \"2001\", \"2001\", \"2002\", \"2002\", \"2003\", \"2003\", \"2003\", \"2…\nYou can see how this could be used to solve our original problem: you can take a named player’s unique team mates and find how many are in common with other named players.\nWhile get_colleagues() effectively returns a filtered dataframe, there’s another function to whittle this down to simpler output.\n\n\n3. Sample from common team mates\nGiven a named player or players, the sample_colleagues() function returns a vector of team mates of size n. These are sampled with a weighting by the total number of Premier League minutes played (a very rough way of outputting more well-known players).\nYou could apply the function to a single named player if you want, which outputs five sampled team mates.\n\nsample_colleagues(\n  all_players = epl_players,\n  players = \"Craig Bellamy\"\n)\n\n[1] \"Jordan Henderson\"   \"Rob Lee\"  \"Freddie Ljungberg\"\n[4] \"Patrick Vieira\"   \"Celestine Babayaro\"\nOf course, if your chosen player is the only common team mate for the set of output players, then you’ve got a decent quiz question to test your pals with!\nTo check, we can feed these names back into sample_colleagues(). I’ve set the argument n = 2: if we get two names then we know the player isn’t the only one in common for these five.\n\nsample_colleagues(\n  all_players = epl_players,\n  players = c(\n    \"Jordan Henderson\",\n    \"Rob Lee\",\n    \"Freddie Ljungberg\",\n    \"Patrick Vieira\",\n    \"Celestine Babayaro\"\n  ),\n  n = 2 \n)\n\n[1] Craig Bellamy\nLegend, journeyman."

See my viva presentation slides here if you don’t really like words.\nOn graduation day, a stranger came up to me and, to paraphrase, said ‘you doctors should be proud of what you’ve achieved, you’re doing a great service’. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I wasn’t a medical doctor. No, I was something nobler and altogether more unique: a doctor of rotting leaves.\nYou’re thinking: ‘gosh, what a complicated subject that must be; how could I ever hope to achieve such greatness?’ The answer is that you should simply take my thesis and use a Markov chain to generate new sentences until you have a fresh new thesis. The output will make probably as much sense as the original but won’t be detected easily by plagiarism software.\nHeck, I’ll even do it for you in this post.\nYou’re welcome.

Selection of the new word is random but weighted by occurrences in your input file.\nThere’s a great post on Hackernoon that explains Markov chains for text generation. For interactive visuals of Markov chains, go to setosa.io.\nText generation is an expanding field and there are much more successful and complicated methods for doing it. For example, Andrej Karpathy generated some pretty convincing Shakespeare passages, Wikipedia pages and geometry papers in LaTeX using the ‘unreasonably effective’ and ‘magical’ power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)."

You can insert one of these section breaks with Shift + Cmd + R, which provides a prompt for you to name the section.\n\n\n\nNot one, but two ways of navigating between sections.\n\n\nThe names of the sections can then be accessed from:\n\nthe document outline panel, which can be accessed by clicking the stacked-lines button in the top-right of the script pane (Shift + Cmd + O)\nthe ‘jump to’ menu in the lower left of the script pane, which also has a little icon to show you what type of section your cursor is in (for example, it’ll show an ‘f’ if you’re in a function definition)\n\n\n\nMagic wand\n\n\n\nSleight-of-cursor.\n\n\nThe ‘magic wand’ menu is available in the script pane and has some features that act a bit like addins. Some frequently-used tools in there for me are:\n\nReflow comment to break a long, ragged comment across multiple lines so it fits into the conventional 80-character width limit (also Ctrl + Shift + /)\nInsert roxygen skeleton to insert a basic {roxygen2} function-documentation block above your function when your cursor is inside it (also Alt + Shift + Cmd + R)\nRename in scope, which selects all instances of the given object name that you’ve highlighted in the script, which means you can then change them all at once without getting into the potential danger of a find-and-replace-all (also Alt + Shift + Cmd + M)\n\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nRStudio has modifiable keyboard shortcuts. There’s a number of default shortcuts that I use frequently:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeys\nAction\n\n\n\n\nCmd + M\nInsert a {magrittr} pipe (%&gt;%)\n\n\nCmd + -\nInsert an assignment arrow (&lt;-)\n\n\nCmd + Shift + Fn + F10\nRestart RStudio\n\n\nCmd + Shift + C\nComment out a selected block\n\n\nCmd + I\nAuto-indent a line\n\n\nCmd + Shift + R\nAdd a section label\n\n\nCmd + D\nDocument an in-development package\n\n\nCmd + L\nLoad an in-development package\n\n\n\nSome shortcuts require you to be an octopus to reach all the keys (I’m looking at you, shortcut-to-restart-RStudio), so modifying your frequently used shortcuts might be a good idea. I’ve got a keyboard with F13 to F15 keys that are otherwise going to waste and as of a recent update, these can be used as mappable RStudio keys.\n\n How to\nYou can see the keyboard shortcuts at Tools &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts Help and modify them in Tools &gt; Modify Keyboard Shortcuts….\n\n\n\n\n.RData\nI like to restart RStudio every few minutes so I know that my environment is empty. This stops me from modifying objects and forgetting about it, which could result in erroneous output.\nThere are default settings that let RStudio open from where you left off, so that the contents of your environment are intact. I don’t like this and it’s advised against in places like the R for Data Science book by Wickham and Grolemund.\n\n How to\nYou can turn off this behaviour in Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; General &gt; Basic &gt; Workspace by unchecking Restore .Rdata on startup and setting Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never.\n\n\n\nOdds and ends\nRapid fire! I also like:\n\nthe 80-character-width guide to show me where to set a line break (Tools &gt; Code &gt; Display &gt; Show margin)\nto be able to scroll beyond the end of a script, so the last line can be seen further up the page (Tools &gt; Code &gt; Display &gt; Allow scroll past end of document)\nto see .Last.value in the environment pane so I can see the most recently created object (Tools &gt; Global options &gt; Advanced &gt; Show .Last.value in environment listing)\nto click the little RStudio cube-logo in the upper-right of the file pane to return to the working directory\nthe spellcheck function (see the ‘ABC-and-tick’ button at the top of the scripting window)\nusing multiple cursors by holding Alt and dragging down, which makes insertion and deletion across multiple lines much easier\n\nYou can learn more tips and tricks from:\n\nthe RStudio cheatsheet\nRStudio tips on Twitter\na recent post by Antoine Soetewey\nthis dataquest post"

    "text": "A biscuit recipe\nSo what if we want to use those closing-paren labels, or ‘biscuits’, instead? There doesn’t seem to be an option in RStudio for that.\nNaturally, I wondered about filling that gap in the market.\nAs a result, consider this post a thought-experiment manifested with some clunky code that is poorly tested and probably doesn’t do exactly what you want it to do. You have been warned.\n\nEasy as A, B, D\nUsing R code, how can you work out the matching parentheses in an expression? Spoiler: it’s not that simple.\nMaybe you could treat an expression as a string, then label the opening and closing parens in forward and reverse order, respectively.\nIn this example, the labels match up the parens for each imaginary function (uppercase for open-parens and lowercase for closing-parens):\n\n\"first(second(third()))\"\n#     A      B     Ccba\n\nBut this simple reversing heuristic doesn’t work for these expressions:\n\n\"first(second(third(), fourth()))\"\n#     A      B     Cd        Dcba\n\n\"first(second(third(')')))\"\n#     A      B     C d cba\n\nIn the first example we’d get the parens for third() and fourth() mixed up. In the second we have a sneaky unopened closing paren inside a string.\nNot forgetting that this doesn’t solve how to extract each function name to use as the biscuit.\n\n\n‘Overengineer’ is my middle name\nRather than the naive approach of chopping up and counting strings, I decided to parse the actual R expressions from them.\nI created a function to do this, add_biscuits(), that contains sub-functions for three steps:\n\n.parse() to interpret the R code from an input\n.label() to match parenthesis pairs by their parent function, grab the parent function name and insert it as a comment after the closing paren\n.format() to stick it all back together and style it\n\nThe rest of the post walks through these functions. I’m certain there’s easier ways to do things, but the code here demonstrates the point I’m trying to reach.\nFor demonstration, we can use one of the trickier examples from above as our input.\n\nstring &lt;- \"first(second(third('x'), fourth('y')))\"\n\n\n1. Parse\nThe .parse() function takes a string containing R code and returns a dataframe of its ‘syntax tree’. In other words, it breaks the string into ‘tokens’ that are recognised as units of R code: function calls, assignment arrows, etc.\nI’ve used getParseData(parse()) to do the hard work of parsing the string into a dataframe with one row per token. The downside is that you must provide to it a file rather than a character object, so we first have to write it to a temporary file.\nI’ve then filtered the dataframe to get only the tokens that are R code (i.e. they aren’t spaces) and renumbered the rows so they’re consecutive. This will be useful when we want to extract the function names for each set of parens.\n\n\nExpand the .parse() function definition\n\n\n.parse &lt;- function(string) {\n  \n  file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".R\")\n  writeLines(string, file)\n  \n  tokens &lt;- getParseData(parse(file))\n  parsed &lt;- parsed[parsed$terminal == TRUE, ]\n  rownames(parsed) &lt;- as.character(seq(nrow(parsed)))\n  \n  return(parsed)\n  \n}\n\n\nHere’s what the output looks like:\n\ntree &lt;- .parse(string)\ntree[, c(\"line1\", \"col1\", \"parent\", \"token\", \"text\")]\n\n   line1 col1 parent                token   text\n1      1    1      3 SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL  first\n2      1    6     40                  '('      (\n3      1    7      6 SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL second\n4      1   13     35                  '('      (\n5      1   14      9 SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL  third\n6      1   19     16                  '('      (\n7      1   20     12            STR_CONST    'x'\n8      1   23     16                  ')'      )\n9      1   24     35                  ','      ,\n10     1   26     23 SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL fourth\n11     1   32     30                  '('      (\n12     1   33     26            STR_CONST    'y'\n13     1   36     30                  ')'      )\n14     1   37     35                  ')'      )\n15     1   38     40                  ')'      )\n\n\nSo each row is a recognised R token, e.g. the function name from the first() function is a SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL and 'x' is a STR_CONSTANT. Parentheses are recognised as separate special tokens too: '(' and ')'.\nWe also get returned the position of each token in the input (line* and col*) and a variable called parent which tells us something about the association of tokens. In our case, opening- and closing-parens have the same parent value.\n\n\n2. Label\nSo we can tie our paren pairs together with the parent variable and we know where to place the biscuit with the line1 and col1 information. But how to extract the function name and ‘biscuitise’ it?\nI’ve written the slightly awkward .label() function for this. It takes the output from .parse() and checks each row to see if it’s a closing-paren token; if so, it finds the position of the matching open-paren by parent; then it looks at the text of the token in the preceding row to get the function name and sticks that in a new column called label.\n\n\nExpand the .label() function definition\n\n\n.label &lt;- function(tree) {\n  \n  tree$label &lt;- NA_character_\n  \n  for (tkn in seq_len(nrow(tree))) {\n    \n    tree$label[tkn] &lt;- ifelse(\n      tree$token[[tkn]] == \"')'\",\n      tree[as.numeric(rownames(\n        tree[tree$parent == tree$parent[[tkn]] & tree$token == \"'('\", ]\n      )) - 1, \"text\"],\n      NA_character_\n    )\n    \n  }\n  \n  return(tree)\n  \n}\n\n\nSo now we have the required biscuit for each closing paren:\n\ntree_lbl &lt;- .label(tree)\ntree_lbl[!is.na(tree_lbl$label), c(\"text\", \"label\")]\n\n   text  label\n8     )  third\n13    ) fourth\n14    ) second\n15    )  first\n\n\n\n\n3. Format\nThe last step needs involves sticking everything back together again. My quick solution is hacky and needs a refactor for sure.\nThe .format() function does a couple of awkward things: recognises and pastes commas to their preceding token (otherwise we’ll get lines in the output that start with a comma, which is valid, but not my style) and pastes in the biscuits with a suffixed # to mark it as a comment. Of course, this blocks downstream code, so we can add a linebreak with \\n.\nThe output is still going to be a bit uggo though, so I employed {styler} to reformat it in tidyverse style. This is very definitely opinionated.\n\n\nExpand the .format() function definition\n\n\n.format &lt;- function(tree_lbl) {\n  \n  tree_lbl$comma &lt;- c(\n    ifelse(tree_lbl$text != \",\", NA_character_, \",\")[-1], NA_character_\n  )  # lag commas\n  \n  tree_lbl &lt;- tree_lbl[tree_lbl$token != \"','\", ]  # remove comma tokens\n  \n  tree_lbl$string &lt;- NA_character_\n  \n  for (tkn in seq_len(nrow(tree_lbl))) {\n    \n    if (!is.na(tree_lbl$comma[tkn])) {  # when there's a comma\n      \n      if (!is.na(tree_lbl$label[tkn])) {  # paste with biscuit\n        \n        tree_lbl$string[tkn] &lt;- paste0(\n          \"\\n\", tree_lbl$text[tkn], tree_lbl$comma[tkn],\n          \"#\", tree_lbl$label[tkn], \"\\n\"\n        ) \n        \n      } else if (is.na(tree_lbl$label[tkn])) {  # paste without biscuit\n        \n        tree_lbl$string[tkn] &lt;- paste0(\n          \"\\n\", tree_lbl$text[tkn], tree_lbl$comma[tkn], \"\\n\"\n        ) \n        \n      }\n      \n    } else if (is.na(tree_lbl$comma[tkn]) & !is.na(tree_lbl$label[tkn])) {\n      \n      tree_lbl$string[tkn] &lt;- paste0(\n        \"\\n\", tree_lbl$text[tkn], \"#\", tree_lbl$label[tkn], \"\\n\"\n      ) \n      \n    } else {  # no comma, no biscuit\n      \n      tree_lbl$string[tkn] &lt;- tree_lbl$text[tkn]\n      \n    }\n    \n  }\n  \n  string_out &lt;- paste0(tree_lbl$string, collapse = \"\")\n  string_out &lt;- gsub(\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", string_out)\n  \n  styled &lt;- suppressWarnings(\n    utils::capture.output(styler::style_text(string_out))\n  )\n  \n  paste(styled, collapse = \"\\n\")\n  \n}\n\n\nLet’s hand over to .format() the labelled tree dataframe that was output from .label():\n\nout &lt;- .format(tree_lbl)\nout\n\n[1] \"first(\\n  second(\\n    third(\\\"x\\\"), # third\\n    fourth(\\\"y\\\") # fourth\\n  ) # second\\n) # first\"\n\n\nSo the output is a character vector, with one element per line of our output R file. You can see in the console how this looks.\n\ncat(out)\n\nfirst(\n  second(\n    third(\"x\"), # third\n    fourth(\"y\") # fourth\n  ) # second\n) # first\n\n\nReal noice: we’ve got a comment after each closing bracket that notes which function it’s closing. You can argue that some of these biscuits are redundant, but the goal has been achieved!\nA reminder of the original input:\n\nstring\n\n[1] \"first(second(third('x'), fourth('y')))\"\n\n\n\n\n4. Combined function\nAnd so, we can put these three steps together in one function: add_biscuits(), which is a cuter name than label_parens() or whatever.\n\nadd_biscuits &lt;- function(string) { \n  .parse(string) |&gt; .label() |&gt; .format()\n}\n\nThe output from each sub-function passes to the next, so it’s a nice chance to use the pipe operator (R &gt;= v4.1).\nLet’s try it on that awkward example with the sneaky extra bracket.\n\nstring2 &lt;- \"first(second(third(')')))\"\ncat(add_biscuits(string2))\n\nfirst(\n  second(\n    third(\")\") # third\n  ) # second\n) # first\n\n\nSo only the ‘real’ closing-paren tokens have been recognised and labelled."

It gets confused if you don’t highlight enough code to capture all the opening and closing parens. It gets confused if you run it over more than one expression.

This process, called sonification, is made simple in R thanks to the {sonify} package.\nObviously it’s far lower stakes, but there’s no reason we can’t take a user’s GitHub contributions data and sonify that too.3 Is that useful? Maybe. Is it it much effort? Not really.\nIt turns out that Skyline has a simple API. Provide a URL in this form to get a JSON back:\nhttps://skyline.github.com/api/contributions?username=username&year=2020\nThis lends itself nicely to a simple R function that grabs the data for a given user in a given year. The counts over time can then be passed to sonification and plotting functions.\nSo… {skyphone}."

Radio towers? Use your imagination, buddy.\nFor a final flourish, we can apply a ridiculous vaporwave-inspired theme to the plot. This retro aesthetic has been rinsed to death of late, so naturally it was used in the Skyline interface.4\nThe {vapoRwave} package has a number of themes we can choose.\n\n# remotes::install_github(\"moldach/vapoRwave\")\nlibrary(vapoRwave)\np + new_retro()\n\n\nSo… that’s it.

You can run some code, or a function from a package, to launch some code in the R console that you can interact with. A simple option for this might involve use of readline() to receive user input, for example, like Giora Simchoni’s excellent text-based puzzler, Castle of R.\n\n\n\nGiora’s Castle of R running in the terminal.\n\n\nShiny can give you a little more flexibility when it comes to graphics and user input, at the expense of needing to host the app and maybe some extra JavaScript skills. A great example of this is Pedro Silva’s winning entry (app, source) to the Posit Shiny contest in 2020.\n\n\n\nA still from Pedro’s Shiny Decisions app.\n\n\nThe third category is a little more boundary-pushing. Imagine if R was powerful enough to let you port existing games. Well, surprise, ya boi Mike Cheng (aka coolbutuseless) has pushed hard on expanding the capabilities of R to run fast enough and with realtime user input,3 porting the classic Another World (1991) to R, which was showcased at 2022’s Posit conference (source, video, blog).\n\n\n\nA still from Mike’s rstudio::conf(2022) presentation, featuring Another World.\n\n\nOf course, within these ‘platforms’ are genres like word games, arcade games, puzzle games, etc. Will you be the first to create an MMORPG (a massively-multiplayer online R-powered game)?"

I’ve updated these to correct some errors and to improve the experience. In particular, I’ve updated the gather() and spread() functions to pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(), given the update in {tidyr} 1.0.0.\nI started with these packages because of the relatively limited number of functions compared to other packages and because they’re involved typically in the early stages of a data analysis workflow.\nTry it by installing Swirl and Tidyswirl:\n\n# Install Swirl\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\")\nlibrary(swirl)\n\n# Install the Tidyswirl course\ninstall_course_github(\"matt-dray\", \"tidyswirl\")\n\n# Start Swirl\n# Tidyswirl will be one of the course options\nswirl()"

    "title": "Iterative R Markdown reports for Dawson’s Creek",
    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nA basic overview of the process is that you:\n\nwrite a template document using R Markdown, with snippets of R code that will pull in the data for each element you’re iterating over (e.g. Dawson’s Creek episodes)\nmake reference to a Word document that contains the style information for your output (i.e. fonts, colours, etc)\nloop over each element (e.g. each episode), supplying data to the template and rendering (‘knitting’) a separate output file for each one\n\n[Update: this approach is quite basic. You may want to read a more recent post on this blog that uses parameterised R Markdown reports and iteration with the {purrr} package, which may suit you better.]\n\nSet up\nI recommend creating an RStudio Project with three files important to this task:\n\nYour document template prepared in R Markdown (file type .Rmd)\nYour style-reference document (.docx) that we’ll put in a style/ subfolder\nA script (.R) file for reading your data and looping through each element\n\nAside from your .Rproj file, your folder should also contain:\n\na subfolder to hold the output files (e.g. output/)\nany additional subfolders you need for input files (e.g. data/ and images/)\nan optional README.md file to explain the purpose of your work\n\n\n\n\nA simple folder setup for your working directory\n\n\nBelow is a more detailed explanation using the Dawson’s Creek example. Click to jump to each section:\n\nthe R Markdown template\nthe Word document used as a style reference\nthe R script for iterating over the template\n\n\n\n1. The template\n\nR Markdown\nYour report template should be an R Markdown file. In short, R Markdown files allow you to write plain text formatted with special symbols and insert R code inline or in ‘chunks’. You can find out more about R Markdown from the RStudio website. I’ve also written a short guide to writing R Markdown documents and created a small set of slides, both with beginners in mind.\nYou can see the full R Markdown file for this demo in the source code on GitHub.\n\n\nSpecify Word output\nThe template itself should start with a YAML header section that states (i) the output type, which is word_document in this example2, and (ii) a path to the Word document that contains the style information (i.e. style/dawson_style.docx in this example). The style document is explained in the next section.\nHere’s what the basic YAML header looks like:\n\n---\noutput:\n  word_document:\n    reference_docx: style/dawson_style.docx\n---\n\n\n\nReference the data\nWe’ll be feeding data into the template via an object called episode. This object is a data frame that contains the variables that we want to put into our template, with one row per episode (more on this in the section below about iterating below).\nWhen it comes to iterating over the data to produce each output file, we’ll be subsetting a row at a time so we only pass one episode’s information to the template.\nThis means the R code in our R Markdown file should refer to the episode object. For example, here’s some inline code that will be rendered into the production code and title (see this in the source repo on GitHub):\n\n`r paste0(episode$production_code, \": '\", episode$title, \"'\")`\n\nAnd here’s an example R Markdown chunk that will get a table containing information about the episodes (see this in the source code):\n\nepisode %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(  # choose these columns for display\n    Season = season,\n    `Number in season` = number_in_season,\n    `Number in series` = number_in_series,\n    `Original air date` = original_air_date\n  ) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()  # print to output table\n\n\n\n\n2. The style\nThe default output when rendering R Markdown to Word is a bit boring. Instead, you can create a separate dummy Word document that contains modified styles to suit your theme.\nYou can read more about creating a style document in Richard Layton’s ‘happy collaboration with Rmd to docx’ on the R Markdown site. Basically you create a dummy document in which you’ve set the formatting for each style element (title, third-level header, paragraph text, etc), store it in your working repository and refer to it from the YAML of your R Markdown report (as mentioned in the section above).\n\n\n\nThe style document\n\n\nYou can download the example style file used in this demo from the GitHub repo.\n\n\n3. Iterate\nSo we have the template (.Rmd) and style (.docx) files in place. Now we need an R script (.R) to orchestrate the iteration of our outputs.\nThis script (i) reads the data and (ii) executes a loop that applies episode data to the template, saving to a specified subfolder with a unique file name. You’ll get one document for each unique element; in this demo we’ll get 13 because there are 13 rows (episodes) in our data set.\nYou can see the script file for this demo in the source code on GitHub.\nAfter reading in the data with something like data &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = \"data/dawsons-creek-season-1.csv\") you can write a loop that looks something like this:\n\nfor (i in data$production_code){  # for each unique episode...\n  \n  # Isolate that episode from the dataset\n  \n  episode &lt;- data[data$production_code == i, ]  \n  \n  # The one-row dataframe object 'episode' we just created will be used as the\n  # source for filling the details in on the template file\n  \n  # Now render ('knit') the R Markdown file to Word format, name it and save it\n  \n  rmarkdown::render(\n    input = \"01_template.Rmd\",  # path to the template\n    output_file = paste0(\"episode_\", i, \".docx\"),  # name the output\n    output_dir = \"output\"  # folder in which to put the output file\n  )\n\n}\n\nSo this code:\n\nloops through episodes given unique values in the production_code column\nsubsets the data object (a data frame of all episodes) to isolate the production code for each episode in turn\nrenders the template document after filling it with the episode data\ngives the file a name that incorporates the production code\nsaves this file to the output/ subfolder in our project directory"

For example, consider the needs of users:\n\nwho are deaf (permanent)\nhave an ear infection (situational)\nare in a noisy location (situational)\n\nDesigning for the permanently deaf could benefit everyone on the continuum. For example, captions on video content make the content accessible for all of these people.\nIt’s worth remembering that the prevalence of disability rises with age and we’re all likely to face impairment at some point.

But can you actually make services accessible for everyone?\n\nIt’s hard to make things 100 per cent accessible for everyone. You just need to make progress and remove exclusionary barriers. The goal is to stop accidental exclusion.\nThis is why user research is important; the guidelines might not actually be relevant for your particular users.\nConsider the passports pages of GOV.UK: putting the information on a single page made it difficult for people with Attention Deficit Disorder to focus, but spreading it across multiple pages was an issue for people with memory problems. Two versions were required.\n\nDoes government have a relationship with producers of assistive technology\n\nThere’s not been a relationship historically, but we’re starting to form them with vendors. It would be great for them to help us with issues like browser compatibility and assistive technologies. We also raise bug reports where we can.\n\nWhat things can we focus on immediately?\n\nUse plain language. The text of hyperlinks must make sense on their own, since a screen reader will read the text to users. It’s not enough to write ‘click here’. Images should have good alt-text so that screen readers can describe an image to visually impaired users. Videos should be captioned.\nFollow good practice as usual, but take it to the next level."

    "text": "What do those words mean?\n\nAnimal Crossing\nAnimal Crossing is a wholesome Nintendo videogame franchise in which you arrive on an island and befriend anthropomorphic animal villagers. You can catch insects and fish, design clothes, fill a museum with fossils, develop the infrastructure of the island and interact with other players. It’s pretty chill.2 The latest version, New Horizons, was recently released.3\n\n\nTom Nook\nTom Nook is a tanuki. Depending on who you ask, he’s either a maniacal rip-off merchant,4 or a misunderstood chap who gives you several interest-free home loans with no obligation.\n\n\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser\nThe in-game currency is Bells, which can be gained by selling things, helping residents, hitting rocks with a spade and joining the ‘stalk market’ by buying and flipping turnips. You use an Automatic Bell Dispenser to deposit, withdraw and make loan payments.\n\n\nR6\nR is primarily a function-focused language: mostly you’re writing functions that output objects.\nBut there’s also Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is common in many other languages. OOP brings together values (fields) and functions (methods) into classes. You can interact with a class via its methods, which may trigger further internal methods and update the values. You can also create subclasses that add to or amend the logic of its parent.\nYou may have heard of the object-oriented systems S3 and S4 in R; R6 provides another, newer implementation of OOP. There are two important things to know about R6 objects. To simplify, they’re:\n\nencapsulated, meaning that you apply the methods to object directly, like object$some_method()\nmutable, meaning that fields are updated as you apply the methods\n\nI’m not going into depth about OOP and R6 here. For more, I recommend:\n\nthe {R6} introduction vignette by Winston Chang\na chapter in Advanced R by Hadley Wickham5\nthe article ‘How to explain OOP concepts to a 6-year-old’ by Alexander Petkov of freeCodeCamp\n\nA really intriguing and illustrative use-case of R6 is Giora Simonchi‘s Castle of R, which is a text adventure game for R (!). Here, classes are things like ’room’ and ‘door’ that have specific properties and actions you can take on them. As you play, the fields are modified depending on your location, interactions you’ve had, or items you’re carrying."

I’ll explain below how to:\n\nstart a new instance of the class\nuse the deposit() method to increase the value of the savings field\nuse the withdraw() method to decrease the savings field\nuse the pay_loan() method to decrease the value of the loan field\n\n\nInitialise\nYou can start, or ‘initialise’, an instance of the class by calling new() on the class name and assigning it. I’ve called my object account.\n\naccount &lt;- AutomaticBellDispenser$new()\n\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,498,000 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 0 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 loan_payment()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n\n\nInitialising the class also triggers the printing of the current account details and instructions. This mimics the interface you see on the Automatic Bell Dispenser in-game.\nIn this case, you can see that we have zero savings, but a multi-million loan to pay off (!). This value represents the final loan amount that Nook sets you in the game.7\n\n\nMake a deposit\nNow we can make a deposit to our account. Use $ notation to say ‘to the account object apply the deposit method’. In this case, the value supplied to deposit is the amount of Bells.\n\naccount$deposit(1000)\naccount  # check status of account\n\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,498,000 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 1,000 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 loan_payment()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n\n\nYou could also access the savings field directly from the account object:\n\naccount$savings\n\n[1] 1000\n\n\nSo we now have savings of 1000 Bells! Of course, I just made up that value. I could add as much as I want. Use your imagination!\nIn the game you have to complete various tasks to add money to your pocket. You can then deposit from your pocket into your savings. I haven’t created the concept of ‘pockets’ in this demo, but you could create a pocket class. You could also, for example, create a fish class with subclasses for each species, including their trade value. You could, in theory, mimic the entirety of Animal Crossing in this way.\n\n\nWithdraw and pay loan\nWe can also withdraw Bells and make loan payments with this class.\nNote that you can chain method calls together with $ between them, so we could withdraw 200 Bells and make a loan payment of 300 Bells at once.\n\naccount$withdraw(200)$loan_payment(300)\naccount\n\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,497,700 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 500 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 loan_payment()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n\n\nSo the loan amount was reduced by 300 Bells, but our savings reduced by 500 Bells (200 + 300 Bells).\nImportant point: notice how we didn’t have to overwrite the account object to update the values? Remember that this is because the class is mutable.\nAs in the game, you can also choose to transfer everything in your savings by providing full_amount = TRUE rather than a value amount.\n\naccount$loan_payment(full_amount = TRUE)\naccount\n\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,497,200 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 0 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 loan_payment()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n\n\nSo the loan balance has gone down by a further 500 bells, which was the remainder of our savings.\n\n\nMessages\nThere are some limits to the Automatic Bell Dispenser system; there’s no overdraft and the outstanding loan amount can’t be negative, for example. I built a few warnings and errors into the class to handle these situations. For example:\n\nwarning – you can only pay in whole Bells (decimal amounts are rounded down to the nearest whole number)\nwarning – you can’t remove more savings than you have (defaults to removing the maximum amount you have in savings)\nwarning – you can’t pay off more than the total loan amount (defaults to paying total remaining loan)\nerror – once you pay off your loan, you can’t make more payments!\n\nYou’ll also get a celebratory message when the loan reaches zero.\nSo, for example, here’s what happens if you try to pay off the loan with more savings than you have and if you also try to pay in decimal Bells:\n\naccount$deposit(1000)$loan_payment(1001.10)\n\nWarning: Payment rounded to 1001 Bells.\n\n\nWarning: Paid total amount from savings instead: 1000 Bells.\n\n\nWe got two warnings:\n\nThe decimal value was rounded down to the nearest integer\nWe tried to pay off 1001 Bells, but only had a total of 1000 Bells\n\nThe result is that our savings are empty and the loan is 1000 Bells lighter.\n\naccount$savings\n\n[1] 0\n\naccount$loan\n\n[1] 2496200\n\n\nAnd if we add enough Bells to pay off the loan?\n\naccount$deposit(2496200)$loan_payment(full_amount = TRUE)\n\n😃 Sweet! I finally finished paying off my very last home loan! 🎉 \n\n\n\n\n\nBuild the class\nI wanted to point out a few elements of the code that went into building the class. You can refer back to the full code in the expandable section above.\nFirst, the basic structure is a call to R6::R6Class(), which contains the name of the class and a list of values and fields.\n\nAutomaticBellDispenser &lt;- R6Class(  # call the function, assign a name\n  \"AutomaticBellDispenser\",  # class name\n  list(\n    # truncated (fields and methods go here)\n  )\n)\n\nThere are two fields in this class, which are put inside the list() with some starting values:\n\n#...\n  # set initial values for fields\n  savings = 0,     # start from zero\n  loan = 2498000,  # loan size\n#...\n\nThere’s an initialize() method that I’ve used to print the Automatic Bell Dispenser display when a new instance of the class is started. It reformats values and uses emoji for the lols.\n\n#...\n  # show on startup the account status and options\n  initialize = function(...) {\n    loan_formatted &lt;- format(  # reformat the loan field value\n      self$loan,          # the 'loan' field from this class (i.e. 'itself')\n      big.mark = \",\",     # format as '1,000' rather than '1000'\n      scientific = FALSE  # prevent 12000000 being displayed as '1.2e+07'\n    )\n    savings_formatted &lt;- format(  # reformat the savings field value\n      self$savings, big.mark = \",\", scientific = FALSE\n    )\n    cat(\"Automatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\\n\\n\")  # cat() prints to console\n    cat(emo::ji(\"bell\"), \"Loan Balance:\", loan_formatted, \"Bells\\n\")\n    cat(emo::ji(\"pig2\"), \"Savings Balance:\", savings_formatted, \"Bells\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\n      \"Please make a selection from the menu below\\n\\n\",\n      emo::ji(\"house\"), \"loan_payment()\\n\",\n      emo::ji(\"arrow_up\"), \"deposit()\\n\",\n      emo::ji(\"arrow_down\"), \"withdraw()\"\n    )\n  },\n#...\n\nThe same code is used in the print() method too, which means that these details will be printed whenever you call your object.\nThe methods for deposit(), withdraw() and loan_payment() look similar, but have slightly different behaviour. The simplest is deposit(), which makes the input an integer and warns the user if a decimal value has been used, then adds the amount to the savings field.\n\n#...\n  deposit = function(amount = 0) {    # function takes an amount to deposit\n    amount_int &lt;- as.integer(amount)  # round to nearest lowest integer\n    if (amount - amount_int &gt; 0) {    # warning if rounding has occurred\n      warning(\n        \"Deposit rounded to \", amount_int, \" Bells.\\n\",\n        call. = FALSE # prevents printing of the error-causing line\n      )\n    } else {\n      self$savings &lt;- self$savings + amount_int  # add amount to savings\n    }\n    invisible(self)  # return but don't print\n  }\n#...\n\nNote how the field values are accessed with self$field_name. We also return self at the end, but it’s wrapped in invisible() so it updates the field without printing."

They’re often functions that you don’t need in your executed script, but can make your life easier by performing some kind of supportive action.\nFor example, you can use the RStudio Addin in the {remedy} package from ThinkR to add Markdown formatting to your text. RStudio’s {reprex} package has a built-in RStudio Addin to create a reproducible example from highlighted code. Or how about Miles McBain’s {datapasta} Addin for pasting conveniently into R scripts from external sources?\nYou can find many more examples in Dean Attali’s {addinslist} package, which itself contains an Addin for… adding more Addins."

I’ve found it useful for keeping on top of deeply-nested Shiny apps.\nA while back I also wrote an Addin for the {r2eng} package to let your computer speak R code aloud as an English sentence.\nI also recently created the {snorkel} R package, which contains an Addin to help you insert {roxygen2} formatting to your function documentation. Turns out Jozef wrote a detailed series about how you can do something similar.\n\n\n\nYou put a snorkel in your mouth to help you breathe oxygen; you put a {snorkel} in your addins to help you write with {roxygen2}.\n\n\nI wanted to write something about how to quickly set up a package to insert or replace text, which I think is probably the most common (simple) use of RStudio Addins.\nEventually I was nerdsniped (unintentionally) on Twitter by Calum to do something about it."

And RStudio already has a button and shortcut in its IDE for inserting R Markdown code chunks, which require triple backticks to demarcate the start and end of the chunk.\nBut an RStudio Addin is another viable method that means you can bundle up a set of functions that insert each of the backtick ‘constructions’, from a single backtick to an R Markdown chunk.\nAs a bonus, you can also set the functions of an Addin to custom keyboard shortcuts and quickly access them from the RStudio command palette (just hit Shift + Cmd + P, or Shift + Ctrl + P, then type the word ‘backtick’)."

    "section": "Add your own",
    "text": "Add your own\nI wanted to record for posterity how you (and me) can create this sort of thing.\n\nFirst, create a new package—I like to use usethis::create_package()—and complete basic things like the DESCRIPTION file (I wrote about this before)\nWrite functions in an R script—I like to use usethis::use_r() to create this script in the package—that insert code or replace selected text using the {rstudioapi} package)\nAdd an inst/rstudio/addins.dcf file4 that declares each of your Addins\n\nPoints 2 and 3 are in scope for this quick post.\n\nUse {rstudioapi}\nWhat do I mean by ‘write functions that insert or replace’ text?\nWell, insertion is straightforward. Here’s the function definition from {backtick} to insert a single backtick:\n\nbt_backtick &lt;- function() {\n  rstudioapi::insertText(\"`\")\n}\n\nIn other words, it’s as simple as a function that contains rstudioapi::insertText(). This fetches information from the IDE to know where the cursor is placed in your script, which is where a supplied text string (a single backtick in this case) will be inserted.\nAnd what about text replacement? A similar story: the {rstudioapi} package is used to detect the selected text, which can then be pasted together with other strings to produce and insert a new compound string. Here’s an example from {backtick} for surrounding selected text with backticks:\n\nbt_backticks &lt;- function() {\n\n  active_doc &lt;- rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()\n\n  if (!is.null(active_doc)) {\n\n    selected_text &lt;- active_doc$selection[[1]]$text\n\n    text_replace &lt;- paste0(\"`\", selected_text, \"`\")\n\n    rstudioapi::modifyRange(\n      active_doc$selection[[1]]$range,\n      text_replace\n    )\n\n  }\n\n}\n\nSo, in short, rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext() fetches information about the script pane, including the current selection. That selection can be pasted with other strings, such as a backtick character at the start and end, and then inserted back into the script pane with rstudioapi::modifyRange() to replace the original selection.\nAnd, well… that’s it for functions. All you need to do now is create a special text file so that the functions can be interpreted as Addins.\n\n\nCreate a dcf\nSo, for example, the bt_bactick() function can be exposed as an Addin function by adding the following to the inst/rstudio/addins.dcf file:\nName: Insert Backtick\nDescription: Insert a single backtick. In R Markdown file, one backtick will be\n    inserted. RStudio automatically adds a second backtick when this function is\n    used in an R script.\nBinding: bt_backtick\nInteractive: false\nThis is pretty straightforward: you provide a name (which will be the name you see in the RStudio Addins dropdown menu) and a description (I just copied the description I wrote for the function documentation), along with the binding (just the function name). There’s also ‘interactive’, which tells RStudio if it needs to wait for the user to do something (no, or false in our example)."

It posts a satellite image from random coordinates in Greater London (well, from a bounding box roughly within the M25 motorway) on schedule. Below is an example image from an existing @londonmapbot tweet. Can you guess where it is?1\n\nThe code for this runs remotely. You can set it up, let it run and never think about it again.\nSo how does it work? A scheduled GitHub Action runs R code to generate random latitude and longitude values, which are sent to the Mapbox API to retrieve a satellite picture. The image is then posted via the Twitter API that is accessed using the {rtweet} package. A link to the coordinates on OpenStreetMap is also included so you can find out exactly where the image is from.\nThe main purpose was to learn more about GitHub Actions, building on my previous posts about using actions for continuous integration, but I think incidentally that the tweets are quite pleasing to look at and to guess where they are."

You can also schedule it with a cron job, to run every hour, once a day, or whatever.\nHere’s what the YAML file looks like for the londonmapbot action:\nname: londonmapbot\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0,30 * * * *'\n\njobs:\n  londonmapbot-post:\n    runs-on: macOS-latest\n    env:\n      TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY }}\n      TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET }}\n      TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n      TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}\n      MAPBOX_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MAPBOX_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master\n      - name: Install rtweet package\n        run: Rscript -e 'install.packages(\"rtweet\", dependencies = TRUE)'\n      - name: Create and post tweet\n        run: Rscript londonmapbot-tweet.R\nIt’s interpreted like so:\n\nthis action is called ‘londonmapbot’\nrun this code at :00 and :30 past each hour4\nthe first (and only) job in this action is called londonmapbot-post\nstart up a remote machine with the latest macOS operating system installed (this is where your code will be run)\nset some environmental variables, in this case keys that will be used to access the Twitter and Mapbox APIs (see the ‘Secrets’ section later in this post)\nthe steps of the job are to:\n\nuse some pre-written code by GitHub to check out the repo\nuse some prewritten code from r-lib that sets up R\ninstall the {rtweet} package and its dependencies\nrun the named R script from the repo\n\n\nI would recommend changing your GitHub notification alerts once the bot is up and running, otherwise you’ll get a message every time the action executes. You can change this under Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; GitHub Actions, where you can uncheck the boxes under ‘Notifications for workflow runs on repositories set up with GitHub Actions’."

    "text": "{rtweet}\nThe action runs an R script that generates content for a tweet and then posts it. This script makes use of the package {rtweet} by Mike Kearney, which lets you interact with the Twitter API with R functions.\nYou need a Twitter account, of course, and also to sign up as a Twitter developer to access the API.\n\n Note\nTwitter has moved to version 2.0 of their API since this post was written. As things stand in February 2022 (hello from the future), you will need to ask for ‘elevated’ access in Twitter’s Developer Portal to ensure you can reach version 1.1 of the API, which is what {rtweet} is set up to communicate with.\nHuge thanks to Oscar Baruffa, who learnt about this hard way when setting up a Twitter bot for the excellent Big Book of R (an index of 250+ free books for R programming).\n\n\nAs a developer, you can create ‘apps’ to obtain keys: private alphanumeric passcodes that grant you access to the API.\nTypically, when working locally, you would either provide these keys as bare strings, or put them in your .Renviron file. With the latter, you can then use Sys.getenv() to call them from your .Renviron, which stops you exposing the raw keys in your code.\nBelow is an example of how you can use {rtweet} to post a tweet from R if you’ve added the keys to your .Renviron.\n\n# Install the package from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"rtweet\")\n\n# Create a token containing your Twitter keys\nrtweet::rtweet_bot(\n  api_key       = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY\"),\n  api_secret    = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET\"),\n  access_token  = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN\"),\n  access_secret = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\")\n)\n\n# Example: post a tweet via the API\n# The keys will are in your environment thanks to create_token()\nrtweet::post_tweet(status = \"This is a test tweet.\")\n\n\n Note\n{rtweet} version 1.0 was released with breaking changes in July 2022 and so I’ve changed the code above to use the function rtweet_bot() instead of create_token(). You can read a separate blogpost about these changes.\n\n\nThis is basically what happens in the londonmapbot R script too. When writing an action, the keys aren’t fetched from your .Renviron file, however. Instead, you can encrypt them on GitHub and provide them in the env call of your action’s YAML file. See the ‘Secrets’ section below for more detail on this.\n\nMapbox\nMapbox is a company with services for mapping, geocoding and navigation, which developers can use for integrating into their apps for things like asset tracking, route optimisation or anything that requires a map interface for users.\nAgain, you’ll need to set up a Mapbox account to get a key for using the API. While the target audience is largely commercial, there appears to be a generous free allowance of 1250 requests per minute for the static image API.\nYou can then pass parameters to the Mapbox API via a URL. This is well explained in the Mapbox Documentation, which has an excellent ‘playground’ interface for you to test out your call.\nYou basically modify a particular URL string to ask the API for what you want. For example, you can ask for a 300x200 pixel satellite image of the coordinates of -0.1709 and 51.5065 with zoom level 12, which is Hyde Park:\nhttps://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9/static/-0.1709,51.5065,12,0/300x200?access_token=YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN\nVisiting the URL in your browser returns the requested image as a JPEG:\n\n\n\nThe Serpentine is so aptly named.\n\n\nOf course, you’ll need to replace the access-token placeholder (YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN) in that URL with your own Mapbox key. Rather than provide this as a bare string, the londonmapbot R script calls it from the environment (like we saw in the {rtweet} code in the last section).\nHere’s the code used by londonmapbot to fetch the satellite image from Mapbox:\n\n# Generate random coordinates\nlon &lt;- round(runif(1, -0.5, 0.27), 4)\nlat &lt;- round(runif(1, 51.3, 51.7), 4)\n\n# Build URL and fetch from Mapbox API\nimg_url &lt;- paste0(\n    \"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9/static/\",\n    paste0(lon, \",\", lat),\n    \",15,0/600x400@2x?access_token=\",\n    Sys.getenv(\"MAPBOX_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN\")\n)\n\n# Download the image to a temporary location\ntemp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".jpeg\")\ndownload.file(img_url, temp_file)\n\nThe code shows a paste0() statement that builds the URL with random latitude and longitude and the Mapbox key. The image from that URL is then downloaded into a temporary file, where it can be supplied to the media argument of rtweet::create_tweet() for posting to Twitter."

You don’t want others to copy and use your keys nefariously, so it’s a good idea not to simply paste them into your code as bare strings for the world to see.\nGithub lets you store secrets securely in the ‘Secrets’ section of the ‘Settings’ tab in your repo. No-one can see these, but they can be called into your code when it runs.\n\n\n\nKeep it secret… keep it safe.\n\n\nLet’s use the londonmapbot Twitter consumer API key as an example. First, I saved the string as a GitHub secret with the name TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY. I then called this in the env section of my YAML file in the form ${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY }}. Running the action results in the string being pulled from the secrets stash and decrypted, where it’s available in the environment. Then the R code can call it with Sys.getenv() when access to the API is needed."

I later tidied the code into a separate R script and declared the secrets in the YAML file. I looked at actions by Matt Kerlogue and David Keyes to do this. David’s repo is interesting from a Twitter perspective because it automates tweets provided via a Google Sheet.↩︎\nI should note that there are already actions on the GitHub Marketplace built specifically for tweeting, but they didn’t quite do what I wanted. I also wanted to write the juicy bit with R code, which I’m most familiar with.↩︎\nThere’s a number of sites that can help you build a cron string.

    "text": "Packages of note\n\n{usethis}\nThe format and content of R packages is objectively odd. What files are necessary? What structure should it have? The {usethis} package from RStudio’s Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan makes it far easier for newcomers and experienced useRs alike.\nIn fact, you can make a minimal package in two lines:\n\ncreate_package() to create the necessary package structure\nuse_r() to create in the right place an R script for your functions\n\nBut there’s way more functions to help you set up your package. To name a few more that I use regularly:\n\nuse_vignette() and use_readme_md() for more documentation\nuse_testthat() and use_test() for setting up tests\nuse_package() to add packages to the Imports section of the DESCRIPTION file\nuse_data() and use_data_raw() to add data sets to the package and the code used to create them\nuse_*_license() to add a license\n\nThere are also other flavours of function like git_*() and pr_*() to work with version control and proj_*() for working with RStudio Projects.\nI focused this year on making different types of package. {usethis} made it much easier to develop:\n\n{altcheckr} to read and assess image alt text from web pages\n{oystr} to handle London travel-history data from an Oyster card\n{gdstheme} to use a {xaringan} presentation theme and template\n{blogsnip} to insert blog-related code snippets via an RStudio addin (there’s even a use_addin() function to create the all-important inst/rstudio/addins.dcf file)\n\nFor more package-development info, I recommend Emil Hvitfeldt’s {usethis} workflow, as well as Karl Broman’s R Package Primer and Hadley Wickham’s R Packages book. To help me remember this stuff, I also wrote some slides about developing a package from scratch with {usethis} functions.\n\n\n{drake}\nYour analysis has got 12 input data files. They pass through 15 functions There are some computationally-intensive, long-running processes. Plots and tables are produced and R Markdown files are rendered. How do you keep on top of this? Is it enough to have a set of numbered script files (01_read.R, etc) or a single script file that sources the rest? What if something changes? Do you have to re-run everything from scratch?\nYou need a workflow manager. Save yourself some hassle and use Will Landau‘s {drake} package, backed by rOpenSci’s peer review process. {drake} ’remembers’ all the dependencies between files and only re-runs what needs to be re-run if any errors are found or changes are made. It also provides visualisations of your workflow and allows for high-performance computing.\nIn short, you:\n\nSupply the steps of your analysis as functions to drake_plan(), which generates a data frame of commands (functions) to operate over a set of targets (objects)\nRun make() on your plan to run the steps and generate the outputs\nIf required, make changes anywhere in your workflow and re-make() the plan – {drake} will only re-run things that are dependent on what you changed\n\nBelow is an extreme example from a happy customer. Each point on the graph is an object or function; black ones are out of date and will be updated when make() is next run.\n\n\n\n‘I’m so glad {drake} is tracking those dependencies between #rstats computations for me’\n\n\nIt’s hard to do {drake} justice in just a few paragraphs, but luckily it’s one of the best-documented packages out there. Take a look at:\n\nthe {drake} rOpenSci website\nthe thorough user manual\nthe learndrake GitHub repo, which can be launched in the cloud\nthe drakeplanner Shiny app\nWill’s {drake} examples page\nthis rOpenSci community call\na Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) paper\nmore things listed in the documentation section of the user manual\n\nI wrote about {drake} earlier in the year and made a demo and some slides. I think it could be useful for reproducibility of statistical publications in particular.\n\n\n{purrr}\nYou want to apply a function over the elements of some list or vector.\nThe map() family of functions from the {purrr} package–by Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham of RStudio–has a concise and consistent syntax for doing this.\nYou can choose what gets returned from your iterations by selecting the appropriate map_*() variant: map() for a list, map_df() for a data frame, map_chr() for a character vector and so on. Here’s a trivial example that counts the number of Street Fighter characters from selected continents. Here’s a list:\n\n# Create the example list\nstreet_fighter &lt;- list(\n china = \"Chun Li\", japan = c(\"Ryu\", \"E Honda\"),\n usa = c(\"Ken\", \"Guile\", \"Balrog\"), `???` = \"M Bison\"\n)\n\nstreet_fighter  # take a look at the list\n\n$china\n[1] \"Chun Li\"\n\n$japan\n[1] \"Ryu\"     \"E Honda\"\n\n$usa\n[1] \"Ken\"    \"Guile\"  \"Balrog\"\n\n$`???`\n[1] \"M Bison\"\n\n\nNow to map the length() function to each element of the list and return a named integer vector.\n\nlibrary(purrr)  # load the package\n\n# Get the length of each list element\npurrr::map_int(\n  street_fighter,  # list\n  length           # function\n)\n\nchina japan   usa   ??? \n    1     2     3     1 \n\n\nBut what if you want to iterate over two or more elements? You can use map2() or pmap(). And what if you want to get the side effects? walk() and pwalk().\n{purrr} is also great for working with data frames with columns that contain lists (listcols), like the starwars data from the {dplyr} package. Let’s use the length() function again, but in the context of a listcol, to get the characters in the most films.\n\n# Load packages\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\nlibrary(purrr)\n\n# map() a listcol within a mutate() call\nstarwars %&gt;% \n  mutate(films_count = map_int(films, length)) %&gt;% \n  select(name, films, films_count) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(films_count)) %&gt;% head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  name           films     films_count\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;list&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 R2-D2          &lt;chr [7]&gt;           7\n2 C-3PO          &lt;chr [6]&gt;           6\n3 Obi-Wan Kenobi &lt;chr [6]&gt;           6\n4 Luke Skywalker &lt;chr [5]&gt;           5\n5 Leia Organa    &lt;chr [5]&gt;           5\n6 Chewbacca      &lt;chr [5]&gt;           5\n\n\nWhy not just write a loop or use the *apply functions? Jenny Bryan has a good {purrr} tutorial that explains why you might consider either choice. Basically, do what you feel; I like the syntax consistency and the ability to predict what function I need based on its name.\nCheck out the excellent {purrr} cheatsheet for some prompts and excellent visual guidance."

Very responsible.\n\n\n{arsenal}\nI’ve been using the handy2 {arsenal} package to compare data frames as part of a quality assurance process. First, you supply two data frames to comparedf() to create a ‘compare’ object. Run diffs() on that object to create a new data frame where each row is a mismatch, given a tolerance, with columns for the location and values that are causing problems. We managed to quality assure nearly a million values with this method in next to no time. Check out their vignette on how to do this."

That includes having to clamber over hedges, swim across ponds, get stuck in bogs and risk the wrath of local farmers and landowners. So far this has covered Wales, Wales again and Norway, with a Scotland series due this month.\nOf course, this requires a lot of planning to decide what the best route is and to make sure you don’t traipse directly through someone’s living room in your muddy boots. Typically this might involve lots of time in GIS software and various online mapping services.\nI learnt recently of the {osmextract} package for the R language, which fetches geographic features from OpenStreetMap, and wondered how easy it would be to use R to do a light-touch assessment of straight line routes in a ‘Mission Across’ style. Basically, can we work out the number and type of obstructions we’d face on a given route?\nYou can jump straight to an interactive map with my example for the Isle of Wight, or keep reading for the code and an explanation.\nAs an aside, Tom has also made the album ‘16 Bit Adventure’ under the moniker ‘Amynedd’; music which accompanies the ‘Mission Across’ videos.

    "text": "Code walkthrough\n\nPackages\nR is very capable as a code-led tool for geospatial manipulation and mapping. Along with {tidyverse} for data wrangling, there’s a few geospatial packages we need: {geojsonio} lets us read GeoJSON files, {sf} is for handling ‘special features’ geometry in a ‘tidy’ way, and {leaflet} lets us create interactive maps. {osmextract} was the main motivation for this post; it fetches OpenStreetMap features pretty painlessly.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(geojsonio)\n  library(leaflet)\n  library(leaflet.extras)\n  library(osmextract)\n  library(sf)\n  library(tidyverse)\n})\n\nAll these packages can all be downloaded from CRAN with install.packages().\nWhile we’re here, I’m going to turn off ‘spherical geometry’. This is a fancy way of saying that we’re going to pretend the Earth is flat (!) to avoid some awkward geospatial maths. I don’t think that’s going to be a big deal for the scale of this demo.\n\nsf_use_s2(FALSE)\n\nSpherical geometry (s2) switched off\n\n\n\n\nThe boundary\nFor purposes of this post, I wanted to look at a small, contained, ‘regularly-shaped’ geographic area to keep things simple. It didn’t have to be a country.\nI settled on the Isle of Wight (IOW)1, a small island off the south-coast of England. It’s mostly rural, with farms, hedges and waterways to cross, but there are certainly more built-up areas. It also helps that the IOW is featured in the {osmextract} documentation!\n\n\n\nThe Isle of Wight: a vexillologist’s delight.\n\n\nFirst thing is to fetch a polygon that represents the extent of the island. Fortunately, Local Authority District (LAD) boundaries for the UK are available to download from the Official for National Statistics (ONS) in GeoJSON form2. We can download the file and filter for the IOW, specifically.\n\n# Download geojson\ngeojson_url &lt;- \"https://services1.arcgis.com/ESMARspQHYMw9BZ9/arcgis/rest/services/LAD_DEC_2020_UK_BGC/FeatureServer/0/query?outFields=*&where=1%3D1&f=geojson\"\ntmp &lt;- tempdir()\ngeojson_path &lt;- file.path(tmp, \"lads.geojson\")\ndownload.file(geojson_url, geojson_path)\n\n# Read LAD boundaries, filter to IOW\niow_extent &lt;- geojson_read(geojson_path, what = \"sp\") %&gt;% \n  st_as_sf(crs = 4326) %&gt;%\n  filter(LAD20NM == \"Isle of Wight\")\n\nunlink(tmp)\n\nI’ve used boundaries that are ‘clipped to the coastline’ because I don’t think you should have to swim out to the low-water mark to complete such a challenge.\n\n\nOpenStreetMap features\nWe want to identify features like hedgerows, buildings and waterways that will become obstructions for our imaginary walk across the island. The oe_get() function from {osmextra} is an easy way to pull features from OpenStreetMap en masse. You can supply a location and receive features within that area.\nFirst, the polygonal features, which you can get with argument layer = \"multipolygons\". You can see that a geometry column is returned, which contains the coordinates for the polygons.\n\n# Fetch polygonal features for IoW\nosm_polys &lt;- oe_get(\n  \"Isle of Wight\", # geographic area of interest\n  layer = \"multipolygons\",  # fetch polygons\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,  # return character-class\n  quiet = TRUE  # don't print info\n) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 4326)  # latlong coord reference system\n\n# Limited preview\nglimpse(select(osm_polys, osm_id, name, type, geometry))\n\nRows: 84,599\nColumns: 4\n$ osm_id   &lt;chr&gt; \"4763\", \"5922\", \"6022\", \"7141\", \"7316\", \"29744\", \"70978\", \"71…\n$ name     &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, \"Ryde Canoe Lake\", \"Quarr Abbey\", NA, \"Be…\n$ type     &lt;chr&gt; \"multipolygon\", \"multipolygon\", \"multipolygon\", \"multipolygon…\n$ geometry &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [°]&gt; MULTIPOLYGON (((-1.251425 5..., MULTIPOLYGON (((…\n\n\nOf course, we can grab line features too. The default for layer is lines, so we don’t need to supply this argument.\n\n# Fetch line features for IoW\nosm_lines &lt;-  oe_get(\n  \"Isle of Wight\", \n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,\n  quiet = TRUE\n) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(crs = 4326)\n\nFor convenience, I’m simplifying the features down to the ones we care about. For Tom, hedgerows were a constant nuisance, waterways were cold and perilous, and buildings could contain angry landowners. We want to avoid them all, ideally.\nWe can create a function to extract named features (we want rows containing ‘barriers’, ‘buildings’, ‘natural’ and ‘waterway’ features), and then iterate over our lines and polygons to isolate them. I’ve put them into a single object so it’s easier to reference them later.\n\n# Filter for a single feature type from oe_get() output\n# 'sf_in' is output from oe_get(); 'feature' is the feature we want\nisolate_feature &lt;- function(sf_in, feature) {\n  sf_in %&gt;% \n    filter(!is.na(sf_in[[feature]])) %&gt;%  # filter for feature\n    select(osm_id, type = all_of(feature), geometry)  # simplify object\n}\n\n# Get all the features as a list object with one element per feature\nfeatures &lt;- map2(\n  list(osm_lines, osm_polys, osm_polys, osm_lines),\n  list(\"barrier\", \"building\", \"natural\", \"waterway\"),\n  isolate_feature\n) %&gt;% \n  set_names(\"barrs\", \"bldgs\", \"natur\", \"wways\")\n\n# Limited preview of the waterways data\nglimpse(features$wways)\n\nRows: 2,714\nColumns: 3\n$ osm_id   &lt;chr&gt; \"3027797\", \"3127808\", \"4680059\", \"5171926\", \"5171930\", \"51722…\n$ type     &lt;chr&gt; \"river\", \"river\", \"river\", \"stream\", \"ditch\", \"river\", \"strea…\n$ geometry &lt;LINESTRING [°]&gt; LINESTRING (-1.272943 50.62..., LINESTRING (-1.290…\n\n\n\n\nThe line\nWe need to specify a straight-line route.3 For this demonstration, and in interests fo speed, I’ve just chosen one that looks alright by eye in terms of obstructions. Kinda.\nOf course, you can use the approach outlined in this post to try other lines and discover quantitatively which ones have the fewest obstructions. That’s the subject of an upcoming Shiny app, which will allow the user to provide a line and get feedback on the number and count of hazards.\nCrucially, the line is clipped to the boundary of the island, so it goes from coast to coast.\n\n# Create a straight line\n# 'x1', etc, are start/end latlongs; 'boundary_poly' is the GeoJSON\nmake_line &lt;- function(x1, y1, x2, y2, boundary_poly) {\n  x &lt;- st_linestring(matrix(c(y1, y2, x1, x2), ncol = 2))  # to matrix\n  y &lt;- st_sfc(x, crs = 4326)  # set coord reference system\n  st_intersection(y, boundary_poly)  # clip line to island boundary\n}\n\n# Hard-coded start/end latlongs\nstart_x &lt;- 50.658; start_y &lt;- -1.472\nend_x &lt;- 50.707; end_y &lt;- -1.101\n\n# Build line between the points, clip to IOW boundary\nline &lt;- make_line(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, iow_extent)\n\nalthough coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersection assumes that they\nare planar\n\n# Preview\nglimpse(line)\n\nsfc_LINESTRING of length 1; first list element:  'XY' num [1:2, 1:2] -1.47 -1.1 50.66 50.71\n\n\nHere’s a quick preview of where our line is:\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = iow_extent) +\n  geom_sf(data = line) +\n  ggthemes::theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe platinum zone\nIn practice it’s very difficult to keep exactly to the line and some deviation may be required at a landowner’s request, for example. What’s an acceptable amount of wiggle room?\nTom spoke in one of his videos about assigning scores to a mission based on minimal deviation from the line. For example, staying within 25 m of the line either side would be a ‘platinum’ standard.\nWe can build a buffer around our line to create a platinum zone, which will be a useful visual aid in the final map.\n\n# Create a buffer around the straight line\n# 'line' as created with make_line(); 25m is 'platinum' standard\nmake_buffer &lt;- function(straight_line, buffer_size = 25) { \n  x &lt;- st_transform(straight_line, crs = 27700)  # line to draw buffer around\n  y &lt;- st_buffer(x, dist = buffer_size)\n  st_transform(y, crs = 4326)  # reset coord reference system\n}\n\n# Generate a 25m buffer ('platinum standard') around the line\nbuffer &lt;- make_buffer(line)\n\n# Preview\nglimpse(buffer)\n\nsfc_POLYGON of length 1; first list element: List of 1\n $ : num [1:123, 1:2] -1.1 -1.1 -1.1 -1.1 -1.1 ...\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr [1:3] \"XY\" \"POLYGON\" \"sfg\"\n\n\n\n\nObstructions\nOur features object currently has all the lines and polygons within the IOW boundary, but we only want the ones that come in contact with (i.e. intersect) with our proposed route. The st_intersects() function from {sf} does exactly that.\n\n# Extract features that intersect with the line or buffer geometry\n# 'features_sf' contains the features; 'path_sf' for what to intersect\nfind_obs &lt;- function(features_sf, path_sf) { \n  row_nums &lt;- st_intersects(path_sf, features_sf)[[1]]  # rows with obstruction\n  slice(features_sf, row_nums)  # extract matching rows\n}\n\n# Find intersection between features and line\nobstructions &lt;- map(features, ~find_obs(.x, line)) %&gt;% \n  set_names(\"barrs\", \"bldgs\", \"natur\", \"wways\")\n\n# Limited preview\nglimpse(obstructions$wways)\n\nRows: 11\nColumns: 3\n$ osm_id   &lt;chr&gt; \"471224569\", \"552565448\", \"552565555\", \"552565565\", \"55650679…\n$ type     &lt;chr&gt; \"stream\", \"stream\", \"stream\", \"stream\", \"ditch\", \"ditch\", \"di…\n$ geometry &lt;LINESTRING [°]&gt; LINESTRING (-1.285131 50.67..., LINESTRING (-1.216…\n\n\nWe can create a quick table to see what the obstructions are for this route.\n\ntribble(\n  ~Type, ~Count,\n  \"Barriers\", nrow(obstructions$barrs),\n  \"Buildings\", nrow(obstructions$bldgs),\n  \"Waterways\", nrow(obstructions$wways),\n  \"Water bodies\", nrow(filter(obstructions$natur, type == \"water\")\n  )\n) %&gt;% knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\nType\nCount\n\n\n\n\nBarriers\n92\n\n\nBuildings\n7\n\n\nWaterways\n11\n\n\nWater bodies\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how this information is useful if you wanted to try other straight-line paths and see how they stack up against each other. Maybe you want to reduce the number of barriers (typically hedgerows); maybe you don’t mind swimming across a large water body.\n\n\nMap\nSo we have the objects we need: our straight-line route, the platinum-zone buffer and all the features that cross our path. Now to map it. We can use the {leaflet} package to layer these up on an interactive map, allowing the user to inspect the route and the hazards along the way.\n\n\nClick to expand the full mapping code\n\nThe basic approach here is to addproviderTiles() for underlying maps (I’ve chosen these to help add extra context to the route); use addPolygons and addPolylines() to supply the line, buffer and the features as separate ‘layers’ that can be turned on or off; use addAwesomeMarkers() for clickable pop-up feature labels; and supply additional mapping conveniences with addMeasure() and, from {leaflet.extras}, addFullscreenControl() (both functions do what their names suggest).\n\n# Set multi-use variables\nmarker_fill &lt;- \"darkblue\"\nicon_fill &lt;- \"white\"\ncol_line &lt;- \"#000\"\ncol_artifical &lt;- \"#F00\"\ncol_water &lt;- \"#00F\"\nweight_line &lt;- 1\nweight_obstruction &lt;- 2\nalpha_all &lt;- 0.5\n\n# Interactive map\nleaflet() %&gt;% \n  # Base groups: map tiles\n  addProviderTiles(\"CartoDB.PositronNoLabels\", group = \"Simple\") %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldTopoMap\", group = \"Terrain\") %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(\"Esri.WorldImagery\", group = \"Satellite\") %&gt;%\n  # Overlay groups: line and buffer\n  addPolygons(\n    data = buffer, group = \"Line/buffer\", \n    color = col_line, weight = weight_line, dashArray = 4, \n    fill = TRUE, opacity = alpha_all\n  ) %&gt;% \n  addPolylines(\n    data = line, group = \"Line/buffer\",\n    color = col_line, weight = weight_line, \n    fill = FALSE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Overlay groups: start and end points\n  addAwesomeMarkers(\n    lng = start_y, lat = start_x, group = \"Start/end\",\n    icon = awesomeIcons(\n      markerColor = \"blue\",\n      icon = \"play\", library = \"fa\", iconColor = \"#FFF\"\n    ),\n    popup = paste0(\"&lt;center&gt;Start&lt;br&gt;\", start_x, \", \", start_y, \"&lt;center&gt;\")\n  ) %&gt;% \n  addAwesomeMarkers(\n    lng = end_y, lat = end_x, group = \"Start/end\",\n    icon = awesomeIcons(\n      markerColor = \"blue\",\n      icon = \"stop\", library = \"fa\", iconColor = \"#FFF\"\n    ),\n    popup = paste0(\"&lt;center&gt;End&lt;br&gt;\", end_x, \", \", end_y, \"&lt;center&gt;\")\n  ) %&gt;% \n  # Overlay groups: features in buffer\n  addPolylines(\n    data = obstructions$barrs, group = \"Barriers\",\n    color = col_artifical, weight = weight_obstruction,\n    label = paste(\"Barrier:\", obstructions$barrs$type)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  addPolygons(\n    data = obstructions$bldgs, group = \"Buildings\",\n    color = col_artifical, weight = weight_obstruction, \n    fillColor = col_artifical, fillOpacity = alpha_all,\n    label = paste(\"Building:\", obstructions$bldgs$type)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  addPolygons(\n    data = filter(obstructions$natur, type == \"water\"), group = \"Water\",\n    color = col_water, weight = weight_obstruction, \n    fillColor = col_water, fillOpacity = alpha_all,\n    label = \"Water body\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  addPolylines(\n    data = obstructions$wways, group = \"Water\",\n    color = col_water, weight = weight_obstruction,\n    label = paste(\"Waterway:\", obstructions$wways$type)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  # Control which layers are shown\n  addLayersControl(\n    baseGroups = c(\"Simple\", \"Terrain\", \"Satellite\"),  # radio button\n    overlayGroups = c(  # checkboxes\n      \"Line/buffer\", \"Start/end\",  # line-related\n      \"Water\", \"Barriers\", \"Buildings\"  # obstructions\n    ),\n    position = \"topright\",\n    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  # Other map features\n  addMeasure(  # tool for users to measure distances\n    position = \"topleft\",\n    primaryLengthUnit = \"meters\",\n    primaryAreaUnit = \"sqmeters\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  addFullscreenControl()  # clickable full-screen button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, you can inspect the route interactively by zoom and dragging, by hovering over highlighted features to see what they are, and by turning on and off the different map and feature layers for more or less context."

You’re also restricted to a two-dimensional overhead view.\nOf course, I also hard-coded the start and end points for this demo.

Set-up\n\nData\nThe dataset is available to download from the RSS website, but it’s small enough that I can just recreate it here exactly.\n\ncotton &lt;- data.frame(\n  Year = 1942:1948,\n  `US consumption` = c(11160, 9993,  9693,  9423,  10072, 9374,  7833),\n  Exports          = c(1480,  1139,  2007,  3613,  3545,  1968,  4785),\n  Stocks           = c(10657, 10744, 11164, 7326,  2530,  3080,  5283),\n  `Total supply`   = c(23297, 21876, 22864, 20362, 16147, 14422, 17901),\n  check.names = FALSE  # allows for spaces in variable names\n)\n\n\n\nFonts\nI’ve used two font families that weren’t pre-installed on my system:\n\nRouted Gothic, a very close match for the general text of the plot\nHussar Bold Condensed, a not-that-great match for the main title, but it’ll do\n\nIt was sufficient for me to install these fonts on my system (macOS Big Sur running R v4.0.5) and invoke them by name, as you’ll see through the rest of this walkthrough. Your mileage may vary.\n\n\nConstants\nI’ve set a few values as objects so they can be reused and changed more easily without having to copy-paste in the body of the script. Note that I’ve used the convention here that constants are ALL_CAPS, so they’re easier to spot in the plotting code.\n\n\nClick for constants (I hid this because it’s dull)\n\n\n# Constants: general\nCEX       &lt;- 0.8      # font size\nYDIV      &lt;- 1000     # division for y-axis\nBLACK     &lt;- \"black\"  # easy to supply off-black instead\nWHITE     &lt;- \"white\"\nXTICK_LEN &lt;- 0.02     # x axis tick length\nYTICK_LEN &lt;- 0.03\n\n# Constants: lineplot (LP)\nLP_YLIM      &lt;- c(0, 12)  # y-axis limite\nLP_WIDTH     &lt;- 3         # width of lines\nLP_YTICK_SEQ &lt;- seq(2, 10, 2)  # y tick locations \nLP_YLAB_SEQ  &lt;- seq(0, 12, 2)  # y label locations\n\n# Constants: barplot (BP)\nBP_YLIM        &lt;- c(0, 25)\nBP_YTICK_SEQ   &lt;- seq(5, 20, 5)\nBP_YLAB_SEQ    &lt;- seq(0, 25, 5)\nBP_SPACE       &lt;- 0.5  # space between bars\nBP_HATCH_ANGLE &lt;- 45   # hatchmark angle\nBP_HATCH_HI    &lt;- 25   # hatchmark density\nBP_HATCH_MID   &lt;- 22\nBP_HATCH_LO    &lt;- 12\n\n\n\n\nStart a graphics device\nWith base plotting you first open a new ‘device’ so that your plotting calls can be captured. You specify things here like the write path and dimensions. When you’ve finished your plotting code, you run dev.off() to close the device and save the output.\nHere I’m using png() so the output is a PNG file. This function is part of the suite of in-built graphics devices from the {grDevices} package, which also includes things like the lossless tiff() format.\n\npng(\n  \"~/Desktop/cottonviz.png\",  # set to a path of your choice\n  width  = 20,\n  height = 12.2,\n  units  = \"cm\",\n  res    = 1200\n)\n\nYou can think of this as setting up a canvas and then you’re going to layer plot objects over the top of it (perhaps not too dissimilar to {ggplot2}). Beware: things like units and placement of elements will be related to the height and width that you’ve declared here.\nThat means you shouldn’t necessarily rely on the graphics windows opened by R or RStudio when previewing the final output; you should rely only on a saved output.\n\n\nPlotting parameters\nWith base R you can set various par()ameters that apply to your plot as a whole. The chart we’re recreating is one row of two plots, so we can use mfrow = c(1, 2), for example. We can also set some global things like the font family.\n\n# Set plotting parameters\npar(\n  mgp = c(0, 0.2, 0),   # gap to tick labels\n  mar = c(3, 2, 4, 1),  # margins\n  mfrow = c(1, 2),      # plot layout\n  ann = FALSE,          # annotation\n  cex.axis = CEX,       # axis font size\n  family = \"Routed Gothic\"  # font family\n)\n\nI’ve selected ‘Routed Gothic’ as the font family and I think it’s a great match. It’s based on the Leroy lettering set that was often used for hand-labelling technical drawings."

    "text": "2. Line plot\nSo, here’s the first ‘hack’. I’m going to set up a ‘fake’ scatter plot with no content and then we’re going to add our desired content to it sequentially. This provides the correct plot dimensions to which we can add bespoke details.\n\n# Dummy x-y scatter plot\nplot(\n  x = cotton$Year,\n  y = cotton$`US consumption` / YDIV,\n  axes = FALSE,    # no axes\n  pch = \"\",        # expunge axes/points\n  ylim = LP_YLIM,  # y-axis min/max limits\n  xaxs = \"i\",      # set 'absolute origin'\n  yaxs = \"i\"\n)\n\nNote the use of yaxs and xaxs = \"i\" which ensures that the axis limits are exactly at the minimum and maximum values for the axis (e.g. it forces [0,0] to be in the extreme lower-left.)\nNow we can build up the plot axes with manual calls to axis().\nIn short, we supply to axis() the side (1 is the x-axis) and the locations for things like labels and tck (ticks). I’ve used separate calls for ticks and labels on the primary y-axis (side = 2) because the min and max values (0 and 12) are actually set just above and below the ticks. I’ve copied the primary y-axis call for a secondary y-axis (side = 4) too.\n\n# Manual x-axis\naxis(\n  side = 1,\n  at = 1942:1948,\n  labels = c(1942, paste0(\"'\", 43:48)),  # i.e. 1942, '43, '44, etc\n  tck = XTICK_LEN,   # tick length\n  col = WHITE,       # i.e. axis isn't visible\n  col.ticks = BLACK  # i.e. axis ticks are visible\n)\n\n# Manual y-axis (just ticks)\naxis(\n  side = 2,\n  at = LP_YTICK_SEQ,  # no ticks needed for origin/max\n  labels = FALSE, \n  tck = YTICK_LEN, \n  col = WHITE,\n  col.ticks = BLACK\n)\n\n# Manual y-axis (just labels)\naxis(\n  side = 2,\n  at = c(0.2, LP_YTICK_SEQ, 11.8),  # min/max labels above/below tick\n  labels = LP_YLAB_SEQ, \n  las = 1,\n  tck = 0,\n  col = WHITE, \n  col.ticks = BLACK\n)\n\n# Manual secondary y-axis (just ticks)\naxis(\n  side = 4,\n  at = LP_YTICK_SEQ,\n  labels = FALSE,\n  tck = YTICK_LEN,\n  col = WHITE,\n  col.ticks = BLACK\n)\n\nI don’t know of a way to make the y-axis label appear horizontally at the top of the axis, so I’ve used mtext() to place a label in the margin (hence the ‘m’ in mtext) space above the plot.\n\n# Y-axis label: horizontal at top of axis\nmtext(\"Millions of Boles\", side = 3, cex = CEX - 0.1, adj = -0.07)\n\nThis gives us all the ticks and labels, but we’re missing the axes themselves. Spear used a box around the whole plot; you can do this in R with a call to box().\n\n# Bounding box around plot boundary\nbox()\n\nHere’s what the plot looks like at this point:\n\nNext we need to actually plot some data! We can use mapply() to pass the parameters to a custom function that contains calls to lines() and text(), which lay down the trace and label for each group iteratively.\n\n# Generate lines and labels for each group iteratively\nmapply(\n  function(type, lty, x, y, label) { \n    lines(cotton$Year, cotton[[type]] / YDIV, lty = lty, lwd = LP_WIDTH)\n    text(x, y, label, cex = CEX)\n  },\n  type = c(\"US consumption\", \"Exports\", \"Stocks\"),\n  lty = c(\"solid\", \"longdash\", \"dashed\"),\n  x = c(1946.5, 1943.7, 1946.2), \n  y = c(11, 3.2, 6.8),\n  label = c(\"U. S. Consumption\", \"Exports\", \"Carry – over\\nstocks\")\n)\n\nI would normally do iterative things with the map() family of functions from the {purrr} package by Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham, so I welcome suggestions on appropriate use of the various base *apply() functions in this scenario.\nFinally we can add the arrows that point to the lines from the labels. Base R has a handy arrows() function to which you supply start and end coordinates and parameters for the arrowhead. I used an advanced-coder technique called ‘trial-and-error’ for this.\n\n# Add arrows from labels to lines\narrows(\n  x0 = c(1945.4, 1944.2, 1945.5),  # arrow origin\n  y0 = c(10.8, 3.2, 7.1),\n  x1 = c(1945, 1944.4, 1945.2),    # arrowhead\n  y1 = c(9.6, 3, 6.8),\n  angle = 12,    # 'pointy-ness'\n  length = 0.07  # arrowhead length\n)\n\nExcellent, that’s the line plot completed. The plot now looks like this:"

    "section": "3. Bar plot",
    "text": "3. Bar plot\nThe barplot() function is a little different to the plot() function.\nIt doesn’t take the data as x and y arguments; we can instead pass it a single object that contains our data with each column corresponding to columns in the plot.\n\n# Convert dataframe structure for passing to barplot()\ncotton_transpose &lt;- t(cotton)[2:4,] / YDIV\ncolnames(cotton_transpose) &lt;- c(\"\", paste0(\"'\", 43:48))\ncotton_transpose\n\n                         '43    '44   '45    '46   '47   '48\nUS consumption 11.160  9.993  9.693 9.423 10.072 9.374 7.833\nExports         1.480  1.139  2.007 3.613  3.545 1.968 4.785\nStocks         10.657 10.744 11.164 7.326  2.530 3.080 5.283\n\n\nNote that I’ve supplied column names here in the form they’ll appear on the plot (e.g. '43), except for the first column, which I’ve left blank because the axis label needs to be applied separately for that one case (1942).\nSpear’s cotton barplot uses hatching (i.e. parallel lines in one direction) and crosshatching (i.e. perpendicular lines laid over each other) to ‘shade’ the bars. This approach was used a lot in manual charting because colour wasn’t necessarily available, and it was easy enough to achieve with a set square and rule.\nR lets you control the density and angle of shading in a barplot(), but the angle can only take one value. To create a crosshatch, you need to lay down a separate barplot() layer that is composed only of hatching in one direction. You can then supply a second barplot() call with the hatching in the other direction.\n\n# Barplot layer with hatching only (allows for crosshatching)\nbarplot(\n  cotton_transpose, \n  axes = FALSE,      # suppress axes\n  xaxt = \"n\",        # suppress x-axis bar labels\n  ylim = BP_YLIM,\n  space = BP_SPACE,  # space between bars\n  border = WHITE,    # border around bars\n  col = BLACK,\n  density = rep(c(BP_HATCH_HI, 0, BP_HATCH_LO), 7),  # line 'closeness'\n  angle = 360 - BP_HATCH_ANGLE  # top-left to bottom-right\n)\n\nThis is the bar plot with only the first layer of hatching:\n\nNote that this layer of hatching is only required in the bottom and top bars of the stack because they will end up being crosshatched, specifically. The middle bar will only be hatched, not crosshatched, so it’s blank in this first layer.\nNow we can apply the rest of the bar plot. Since we want to add this barplot() call on top of the previous one, we need to use the argument add = TRUE.\n\n# Barplot layer with features\nbarplot(\n  cotton_transpose, \n  axes = FALSE,\n  ylim = BP_YLIM,\n  space = BP_SPACE,\n  col = BLACK,\n  density = rep(c(BP_HATCH_HI, BP_HATCH_MID, BP_HATCH_LO), 7),\n  angle = BP_HATCH_ANGLE, # bottom-left to upper-right\n  add = TRUE              # add as layer on top of existing plot\n)\n\nAnd now we have both layers of hatching, the bar boundaries and the x-axis bar labels:\n\nYou’ll notice I suppressed the axes again. The approach to building the bespoke bar plot axes is very similar to that of the line plot, using axis(), box() and mtext().\n\n# Manual y-axis (just ticks)\naxis(\n  side = 2,\n  at = BP_YTICK_SEQ,\n  tck = YTICK_LEN,\n  labels = FALSE,\n  col = WHITE,\n  col.ticks = BLACK\n)\n\n# Manual y-axis (just labels)\naxis(\n  side = 2,\n  at = c(0.4, BP_YTICK_SEQ, 24.6), \n  tck = 0, \n  labels = BP_YLAB_SEQ, \n  las = 1, \n  col = WHITE\n)\n\n# Manual secondary y-axis (just ticks)\naxis(\n  side = 4,\n  at = BP_YTICK_SEQ,\n  labels = FALSE,\n  tck = YTICK_LEN,\n  col = WHITE,\n  col.ticks = BLACK\n)\n\n# X-axis label: horizontal at top of axis\nmtext(\"Millions of Boles\", side = 3, adj = -0.09, cex = CEX - 0.1)\n\n# The first label is at the origin\nmtext(\"1942\", side = 1, line = 0.2, adj = -0.06, cex = CEX)\n\n# Bounding box around plot boundary\nbox()\n\nAwkwardly, the first x-axis label in the bar plot (1942) has to be created manually because it’s placed under the origin point in the original chart, rather than under the bar itself, which is the default.\nFinally we can add the labels over the top of the bars. I’ve done this in a similar iterative manner as the line plot, where there’s a call to create a white box with rect(), over which a text() label can be applied.\n\n# Apply labels iteratively\nmapply(\n  function(x, y, xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop, label) { \n    rect(xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop, col = WHITE, border = NA)\n    text(x, y, label, cex = CEX)\n  },\n  xleft   = c(4.4,  4.3,  3.2),\n  ybottom = c(14.4, 10.4, 6.4),\n  xright  = c(6.6,  6.7,  7.8),\n  ytop    = c(15.6, 11.6, 7.6),\n  x = 5.5,\n  y = c(15, 11, 7),\n  label = c(\"STOCKS*\", \"EXPORTS\", \"U. S. CONSUMPTION\")\n)\n\nAnd here’s our visualisation with both plots completed:"

Margin labels\nWith both charts completed, we can add with mtext() the titles and captions that exist for the plot as a whole.\nThe main title uses a different font family than was specified in par(), so we override it with the family argument.\nI couldn’t find a good (free) approximation of the font family that Spear used, so I’ve used one that has a similar ‘feel’, even if many of the typographical features are wrong (e.g. single-storey ‘a’). Here I’ve settled with ‘Hussar Bold Condensed’. Let me know if you recognise Spear’s actual font.\n\n# Main title\nmtext(\n  text = \"Distribution   of   United   States   Cotton\",\n  outer = TRUE,  # outer plot margin\n  side = 3,      # i.e. the top\n  line = -3,     # relative to outside to plot limit\n  cex = CEX + 0.5,\n  family = \"Hussar Bold Condensed\",\n  font = 2       # bold type\n)\n\nI left extra spaces between the words in the title text to approximate their placement in Spear’s image.\nThe remaining labels were just a case of fiddling with the line and at arguments to get them in the right place.\n\n# 'Subtitle' for line plot\nmtext(\n  text = \"MULTIPLE CURVE\",\n  outer = TRUE,\n  side = 3,\n  line = -1,\n  adj = 0.06,  # nudge\n  cex = CEX,\n  font = 3  # italic\n)\n\n# 'Subtitle' for bar plot\nmtext(\n  text = \"COMPONENT COLUMN\",\n  outer = TRUE,\n  side = 3,\n  line = -1,\n  adj = 0.68,\n  cex = CEX,\n  font = 3\n)\n\n# Caption: source\nmtext(\n  text = \"Source: U.

There were some particularly tricky things I was able to deal with, but also some things that I need to improve to make the recreation identical to the original.\n\nTricky parts\nThere were a few non-standard plot elements that needed to be dealt with, but are relatively trivial with base R functions. To review:\n\nthe minimum and maximum labels on the y axis are not on the ticks, they’re slightly above and below them, respectively\nhatching can only be done in one direction, so it requires an ‘under-layer’ of hatching in the opposite direction to that of the main plot itself\nthere’s no function in base to apply a text label with a filled box under it; you need to use text() and rect() together\nthe x-axis labels aren’t all the same: the first is 1942 and the rest are in the form '43\nthe first x-axis label on the bar chart, 1942 is not actually under the bar, but under the origin\n\n\n\nImprovements\nThere’s a lot of things I could do, but there would be a few things to prioritise:\n\nI’ve used a lot of manual adjustments to get the chart elements in roughly the right place; that’s fine for a one-off chart like this, but isn’t that useful for making this code more generic\nI didn’t get the ruler out and measure everything, so there are slight differences when the original and recreation are overlaid\nI haven’t really optimised the code or tried to tidy it up; there may be some unnecessary lines that were part of development that don’t need to be in the final script\nI’ve tried to match the font families as best I can, but the font used in the main title is particularly difficult to find a (free) match for\nR’s built-in line dashes aren’t quite the same as Spear’s, but I think they’re close enough\n\nAnd finally a bonus improvement, though it requires you to download a package. We can save our plot with maximum resolution, etc, but for fun we can invoke some of the artefacts that are present in Spear’s plot with some help from the {magick} image-processing package via Jeroen Ooms and rOpenSci (e.g. see below for how to add blur).\n\nlibrary(magick)  # install from CRAN\n\n# Read the plot PNG\ncottonviz &lt;- image_read(\"~/Desktop/cottonviz.png\")  # set to your path\n\n# Apply blurring parameters\ncottonviz_blur &lt;- image_blur(\n  cottonviz,\n  radius = 14, sigma = 7  # blur parameters\n)\n\n# Save the image\nimage_write(\n  cottonviz_blur,\n  \"~/Desktop/cottonviz_blur.png\"  # set to your path\n)\n\nThat would end up looking like this:\n\nWith a bit more tweaking and addition of some noise, you could probably do a good job of mimicking the ‘aged’ look of the original."

You can read earlier posts about how it was made and how I mapped the points interactively.\nI figured we could sample these to get to ‘the colours of London’, which can be mapped or tiled.\nThis is not too dissimilar to efforts to find the ‘average colour’ of countries of the world, which Erin wrote a nice post about, for example.1 The difference is that we aren’t finding a colour to represent London, we’re representing London with a series of single-colour points.\nThis is relatively trivial with the packages {rtweet} to pull tweets and {magick} to manipulate the images. We can use {sf} to place the points on a map and {ggplot2} for other visualisations."

    "text": "Get bot log\nFirst, load the packages we need. You’ll need to use install.packages() for each one if you haven’t already installed them.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(rtweet)\n  library(magick)\n  library(tidyverse)\n  library(sf)\n})\n\n{rtweet} makes it very easy to collect tweet content. To the get_timeline() function you can pass an account name and the number of tweets you want to fetch. You’ll need to set up authenication first, of course.\n\ntweets_read &lt;- get_timeline(\"londonmapbot\", n = 625)\n\nWhy do I want 625? Well, the bot has tweeted out nearly 9000 images at time of writing, but I want a useable number for this post. (Spoiler: I also want to make a 25 by 25 grid of squares as one of my outputs.)\nThe function actually returns more than 625 because {rtweet} maximises the number of tweets it fetches for each API call. Better to return more than you asked for, rather than less.\nThe returned tibble contains a lot of information. I’m only interested in the media_url and text columns, from which I can extract the satellite image URLs and, with some regular expressions, the coordinate information that’s provided in the body of the tweet.\n\ntweets &lt;- tweets_read %&gt;% \n  transmute(media_url = unlist(media_url), text) %&gt;% \n  transmute(\n    media_url,\n    latitude = str_extract(text, \"^\\\\d{2}.\\\\d{1,4}\"),\n    longitude = str_extract(text, \"(?&lt;=, ).*(?=\\nhttps)\")\n  ) %&gt;% \n  slice(1:625)\n\nSo we’ve got a tibble with 3 columns and 625 rows.\n\nglimpse(tweets)\n\nRows: 625\nColumns: 3\n$ media_url &lt;chr&gt; \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7BOglJVgAEE3XL.jpg\", \"http://pb…\n$ latitude  &lt;chr&gt; \"51.5651\", \"51.4665\", \"51.3752\", \"51.5041\", \"51.5668\", \"51.3…\n$ longitude &lt;chr&gt; \"0.0466\", \"-0.3526\", \"-0.1997\", \"-0.0174\", \"-0.1882\", \"-0.13…\nI’m going to iterate through each URL to download the associated image to a temporary directory. I’ve used a walk() function from {purrr} rather than map() because we aren’t returning anything; we’re saving a file to a folder.\nSpecifically, I used walk2(), which lets me supply two values to the iterate process: the URL and also the iteration number for that URL. That means I can print a message in the form ‘Fetching 1 of 625’ and get a rough idea of progress.\nI’ve also added a Sys.sleep() call to slow the process, as not to hammer the Twitter API too hard.2\n\n# Function: download images from URLs\ndownload_images &lt;- function(paths, dir) {\n  \n  Sys.sleep(sample(0:2, 1))  # random pause\n  \n  tw_df &lt;- data.frame(number = 1:length(paths), url = paths)\n  \n  purrr::walk2(\n    tw_df$number, tw_df$url, \n    ~ { cat(\"Fetching\", .x, \"of\", length(tw_df$number), \"\\n\")\n      download.file(.y, file.path(dir, basename(.y))) }\n  )\n  \n}\n\nSo, you can pass a vector of URLs and a directory path to the function. For purposes of this post, I’m going to save the files to a temporary folder.\nThat call takes a little while and the duration will vary given the random pauses built into the function. I’ve hidden the output because there would be 625 items printed to the console. An example of the output:\n\nFetching 479 of 625 \ntrying URL 'http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6Akw2fXMAA3VSk.jpg'\nContent type 'image/jpeg' length 113537 bytes (110 KB)\n==================================================\n  downloaded 110 KB\n\nTo prove this has worked, we can fetch all the image paths from the directory in which they’re stored and count how many there are.\n\nfiles &lt;- list.files(tmp, \".jpg$\", full.names = TRUE)\nlength(files)\n\n[1] 625\nGreat, as expected. Now we have a set of satellite images that we can manipulate."

You could, for example, use this for reducing the number of colours in an image to make it easier to compress while minimising information loss. We’re going to quantize to just one colour to find the colour that best represents the image.

Maybe it’s greener in the suburbs? (It’s a serious question; I’m a deuteranope.)3\n\n\nVisualisation: tiles\nRecently I’ve written some posts involving R and abstract art (like pixel art and a Shiny app to remix art by Sol LeWitt).\nSo why not get more abstract with these data points? We can create squares of each colour and tile them.\nHere the tiles are laid out row by row from right to left, in a more-or-less random order.\n\nhex_tiles &lt;- crossing(x = 1:25, y = 1:25) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols(hex = tweets_cols$hex)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_tile(aes(hex_tiles$x, hex_tiles$y), fill = hex_tiles$hex) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor fans of order, we could instead arrange them by brightness, or ‘luminance’.4 Here I’ve modified a simple approach by Wouter van der Bijl from a StackOverflow post.\n\n# Get luminance for hex values\nrgb_vals &lt;- col2rgb(tweets_cols$hex)  # Hex to RGB\nlab_vals &lt;- convertColor(t(rgb_vals), 'sRGB', 'Lab')  # RGB to Lab\nhex_lum &lt;- tweets_cols$hex[order(lab_vals[, 'L'])]  # luminance order\n\n# Set up dummy xy tile locations\ncross_xy &lt;- crossing(y = 1:25, x = 1:25)\n\n# Create tibble of x, y, hex luminance\nhex_tiles_bright &lt;- tibble(\n  x = cross_xy$x,\n  y = rev(cross_xy$y),\n  hex = hex_lum\n)\n\n# Plot so 'lightest' in top left, 'darkest' in bottom right\nggplot(hex_tiles_bright) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x, y), fill = rev(hex_tiles_bright$hex)) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe colours make me think of the classic smoggy ‘pea souper’ of London in times past, which is fitting.\nOr, y’know, sewage.\nOf course, there’s lots more images available in the londonmapbot feed and many other ways to visualise these data, so I may return to this idea in the future."

Maybe it’ll work on your machine?\nNote that I’ve selected a subset of possible punctuation marks. There’s no reason why you couldn’t update the punct_rx object, which contains a regular expression, to include more marks. You could even use R’s built-in \"[[:punct:]]\" declaration to capture them all.\nI decided to colour by ‘type’ of mark: terminal (period, exclamation and question), ‘continuing’ marks (comma, semi-colon and colon), parenthetical (open and close) and quote signifiers (quotation marks and apostrophes, recognising that apostrophes are more likely to be used for contractions).\nThere were a couple of technical annoyances to deal with in the function definition; let me know what you would improve.2\n\n\n{gutenbergr}, dead ahead!\nLet’s inspect the punctuation from some books on Project Gutenberg, ‘a volunteer effort to digitize, archive, and distribute literary works’.\nHelpfully, we can interact with Project Gutenberg’s library via the {gutenbergr} package by David Robinson.3\nHere’s some random books.\n\nlibrary(gutenbergr)\nlibrary(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nsample_n(gutenberg_metadata, 5) %&gt;% select(1:3)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  gutenberg_id title                                    author          \n         &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                    &lt;chr&gt;           \n1        54611 Mental diseases: a public health problem May, James Vance\n2        56216 Rodney, the Overseer                     Castlemon, Harry\n3         2512 The Cruise of the Snark                  London, Jack    \n4        62321 The Flame Breathers                      Cummings, Ray   \n5        50613 My Short Story Book                      Various         \n\n\nYou could filter for a particular author or title, like Franz Kafka.\n\ngutenberg_metadata %&gt;% \n  filter(str_detect(author, \"Kafka\")) %&gt;%\n  select(1:3) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  gutenberg_id title                    author      \n         &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;chr&gt;       \n1         5200 Metamorphosis            Kafka, Franz\n2         7849 The Trial                Kafka, Franz\n3        16304 Der Heizer: Ein Fragment Kafka, Franz\n4        19638 Auf der Galerie          Kafka, Franz\n5        20045 Großer Lärm              Kafka, Franz\n\n\nI’ve chosen Edwin A Abbott’s Flatland (1884) for the main example in this post.

A key part of the recipe is a short cron string that provides instructions about when to run it.\nThe problem: cron strings are a bit cryptic if you’re not a sysadmin and don’t set up cron jobs very often. Here’s a contrived example: \"0/15 * 1,3,20 6 2,3\". What the heck does that mean?\nCase study: me. I’ve been scheduling GitHub Actions using cron strings to specify when the actions should be triggered. For example, I set up a Twitter bot called londonmapbot that currently tweets a random aerial image every half-hour.\nThere’s a bunch of webservices like crontab.guru that help you construct cron expressions. I wondered if I could build one in R. It’s basically just a bunch of string handling and if statements, right? And while you’re at it, why not offer translation the other way? You have a cron string and you want to ‘translate’ it to English. Could be helpful."

    "section": "{dialga} demo",
    "text": "{dialga} demo\nThe package is available on GitHub; there are no plans for it to go on CRAN. You can use the {remotes} package to help you download {dialga} easily from the web.\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not already installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/dialga\")\nlibrary(dialga)\n\nIn the same vein as the {r2eng} package, the two functions are named r2cron() and cron2eng(). This is pretty self-explanatory: r2cron() takes R inputs as integer vectors and spits out a cron string, and cron2eng() takes a valid cron string and prints out a readable English version.\nAs ever, it was banged-out in a couple of days and I can’t promise it’s bug-free. Let me know if you find anything broken horribly.\n\n Note\nThe package moved to v0.1 since this post was published. The update removed all dependencies, improved the documentation and set clipboard-copying behaviour to FALSE by default. Feel free to offer more improvements.\n\n\nA primer\nBut first, a quick demo on standard cron expressions. Their format is a string of five time-period ‘slots’ separated by spaces. The slots from left to right specify the minutes, hours, days of the month, months, and days of the week that you want to schedule your script to run.\nThe format required for the values in these slots can be expressed relatively easily as R code, which is what r2cron() uses as input. For example, this table shows cron-string formats for the minutes slot and the corresponding R integer vector for them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nCron\nR\n\n\n\n\nEvery minute (minutes 0 to 59)\n*\n0:59\n\n\nA single minute (5)\n5\n5\n\n\nA consecutive sequence of minutes (1, 2 and 3)\n1-3\n1:3\n\n\nSeveral irregularly-spaced minutes (1, 15 and 17)\n1,15,17\nc(1, 15, 17)\n\n\nA sequence of minutes at regular intervals for the whole hour, starting with some value (every 15 minutes starting at minute 0)\n0/15\nseq(0, 59, 15)\n\n\n\nThe same principles extend to the other time-period slots, but the ranges will obviously differ. For example, the hour slot can take values 1 to 23 (i.e. a 24-hour clock), while the days of the week are zero-indexed from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday). An asterisk is a special character meaning every unit of that time period, like every minute and every hour.\nSo ‘every 30th minute past the hour’ would be \"30 * * * *\". The contrived example string from the opening of this post—\"0/15 * 1,3,20 6 2,3\"—translates as ‘every 15 minutes starting from minute 0 of every hour, on the 1st, 3rd and 20th of June; and Mondays and Tuesdays’.\nTo help simplify things, the r2cron() function lets you specify each slot in turn as arguments. Each input is an R expression like in the table above. You don’t have to worry about cron-specific symbols, you just provide the appropriate integer vector.\n\n\nSimple example\nHow would you specify the 28th minute past 11PM every day with r2cron()? You pass the value 28 to the minutes argument and 23 to the hours argument. The resulting cron string has a 28 in the minutes slot and a 23 in the hours slot, as expected.\n\nx &lt;- dialga::r2cron(\n  minutes = 28, \n  hours = 23  # 24-hour clock\n)\n\nx\n\n[1] \"28 23 * * *\"\n\n\nGreat, there’s our cron string!\nYou may have noticed from the documentation that there’s also a clip argument. This is for your convenience; when set to TRUE, the output will be copied to the clipboard for you to paste elsewhere, like into the YAML of a GitHub Action in my case. You will need separately to install {clipr} yourself from CRAN if you want this functionality in {dialga}.\nCool, but how do we know this worked? We could pass the cron string into cron2eng() to confirm it.\n\ndialga::cron2eng(x)\n\nCron string '28 23 * * *' means:\n  - minute(s) 28\n  - hour(s) 11PM\n  - every day(s) of the month\n  - every month(s)\n  - any day(s) of the week\n\n\nThis text output isn’t sophisticated, but it communicates the point. I’ve chosen to keep it simple by breaking it into bullet points, rather than wrestling the output into a potentially confusing single sentence.\nOf course, this means you could pipe these functions together to go from R to cron to English in one go.\n\nlibrary(magrittr)  # for %&gt;%\n\ndialga::r2cron(minutes = 28, hours = 23) %&gt;% \n  dialga::cron2eng()\n\nCron string '28 23 * * *' means:\n  - minute(s) 28\n  - hour(s) 11PM\n  - every day(s) of the month\n  - every month(s)\n  - any day(s) of the week\n\n\nIt might be nice to produce eventually an eng2cron() function that goes directly from a text description to the appropriate cron string, but I think that would be a fair amount of effort.\n\n\nMore complex example\nWe can see the flexibility of r2cron() with an unlikely scheduling request like ‘every 20 minutes from the top of the hour (minute 0) of 3PM, 4PM and 5PM, on the 1st days of April, October and November, plus every weekend’. Again, we can specify these as R integer vectors.\n\ny &lt;- dialga::r2cron(\n minutes = seq(0, 59, 20),\n hours = 15:17,  # 24-hr clock\n days_month = 1,\n months = c(4, 10, 11),\n days_week = c(1, 7)  # Sunday is '1'\n)\n\ny\n\n[1] \"0/20 15-17 1 4,10,11 0,6\"\n\n\nNote that the input to the days_week argument isn’t zero-indexed even though the cron format is zero-indexed; Sunday is 1 in r2cron(), not 0. This is to conform better to the fact that R doesn’t typically zero-index things. r2cron() converts days_week = 1 into 0 for this slot automatically.\nAnd of course, we can express the output of this complicated cron string in English:\n\ndialga::cron2eng(y)\n\nCron string '0/20 15-17 1 4,10,11 0,6' means:\n  - every 20 minute(s) starting from minute(s) 0\n  - hour(s) 3PM to 5PM\n  - day(s) of the month 1\n  - month(s) April, October and November\n  - and day(s) of the week Sunday and Saturday\n\n\n\n\nWarnings\nAs a courtesy, you’ll be warned when unlikely dates arise. Some are impossible, like 31 September and others are rare, like 29 February. It’s important that these are warnings and not errors though, since you might legitimately want the job to run on 31sts when available, or the 29 February only (i.e. every four years).\nThis example hits all the warnings:\n\ndialga::r2cron(days_month = 28:31, months = 2)\n\nWarning in dialga::r2cron(days_month = 28:31, months = 2): \n  Sure? There's no 31st in Feb, Apr, Jun, Sept nor Nov.\n\n\nWarning in dialga::r2cron(days_month = 28:31, months = 2): \n  Sure? There's no 30th in Feb.\n\n\nWarning in dialga::r2cron(days_month = 28:31, months = 2): \n  Sure? 29 Feb is only in leap years.\n\n\n[1] \"* * 28-31 2 *\""

The procedure is very simple: lay a map made entirely of wall tiles; select random sites for rooms5 and replace with floor tiles; connect them with floor-tile corridors; expand the floor tiles generatively.\nThe corridors are particularly important. Laying corridors is a cheap way of making all areas of the dungeon accessible, which maximises the opportunity for exploration. Vanilla implementations of some other approaches, like using perlin noise, would need post-processing to make sure isolated caves are connected up.\n\n Note\nAfter publishing this post, I had a quick play around with perlin noise for seeding dungeons. I put code and an example output in a small GitHub Gist. It uses noise_perlin() from the {ambient} package.\n\n\nFunctions\nThese steps are handled in the generate_dungeon() function by a few sub-functions, which looks a bit like this:\n\nm &lt;- .create_dungeon(n_row, n_col, n_rooms)\n\nm &lt;- .connect_dungeon(m, is_snake)\n\ni &lt;- 0\n\nwhile (i &lt; iterations) {\n  m &lt;- .grow_dungeon(m)\n  i &lt;- i + 1\n}\n\n.draw_dungeon(m, colour)\n\nNot much right? But what’s actually happening?\n\nFirst, .create_dungeon():\n\nprepares a matrix with dimensions n_row and n_col\nfills the matrix with tiles that represent non-traversable rocky cave walls (#)\nselects randomly an n_rooms number of non-edge tiles in that map and replaces them with traversable cavern-floor tiles (.)\n\nThen .connect_dungeon() (this function is run now if is_organic = TRUE, otherwise after .grow_dungeon() in the next step):\n\nconnects rooms with straight, right-angled corridors made of floor tiles (connected from lowest to highest if is_snake = TRUE, otherwise randomly)\n\nNow the iterative bit, .grow_dungeon(), which happens in a while-loop whose iterations are determined, which:\n\nspawns randomly with sample() a new cavern-floor tile to the north, south, east or west or current floor tiles\nperforms one round of spawning for the number of iterations provided\n\nFinally, .draw_dungeon():\n\nprints to the console, using cat(), each line of the matrix in turn\ncolours the output with the {crayon} package, if requested\n\n\nAnd we can look at the output at each step to see what’s going on:\n\nSo, the map started with four randomly-selected floor tiles; these were joined with straight, right-angled corridors; then three iterations expanded out the floor space from the existing floor tiles.\n\n\nSampling\nWhat does it mean to ‘expand out the floor space’? Let’s focus on the little bit of the .grow_dungeon() function that actually does this.\nHere’s a tiny example matrix of wall tiles with a floor tile in the middle:\n\nm &lt;- matrix(\"#\", 3, 3)  # wall tiles\nm[2, 2] &lt;- \".\"  # floor tiles\nm\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,] \"#\"  \"#\"  \"#\" \n[2,] \"#\"  \".\"  \"#\" \n[3,] \"#\"  \"#\"  \"#\" \n\n\nNow we find the adjacent tiles and sample a random number of them to also become floor tiles.\n\nstart_tile &lt;- which(m == \".\")\n\nadjacent_tiles &lt;- c(\n  start_tile - 1,        # north\n  start_tile + 1,        # south\n  start_tile - ncol(m),  # east \n  start_tile + ncol(m)   # west \n)\n\nchange_to_floor &lt;- sample(\n  adjacent_tiles,\n  sample(1:length(adjacent_tiles), 1)\n)\n\nm[change_to_floor] &lt;- \".\"\n\nm\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,] \"#\"  \"#\"  \"#\" \n[2,] \".\"  \".\"  \"#\" \n[3,] \"#\"  \".\"  \"#\" \n\n\nSo one, two, three, or all of the adjacent tiles could be turned to a floor tile.\nThis is then repeated for the number of iterations provided by the user."

Well, the {r.oguelike} package already has the rudiments of gameplay in the start_game() function, so the next step is to place the player, enemies and items into these dungeon spaces and let the player explore them.\nIdeally we can also create a system to place certain objects in certain spaces, like treasure in the far reaches of a dead-end, or a monster that’s in a narrow corridor and must be defeated to advance. Stuff like locked doors would be great too.\nThat’s much more roguelike-like, like, amirite?\n\n Note\nJust after writing this post, I added code from generate_dungeon() into start_game(), so new games will now start with a procedural dungeon. It seems to work pretty well."

To my southern English ears, it seems like there were a few patterns:\n\nEnglish word pronounced as expected: {haven}, {broom} and {glue}\nAmerican English: {crayon} (‘crain’)\nunexpected English parsing: {lubridate} (‘loobridot’)\nthe trouble with ‘tidy’: {tidyr} (‘tid-ear’ instead of ‘tidy-arr’) and {tidyverse} (‘tid-a-verse’ instead of ‘tidy-verse’)\nthe trouble wirh ‘r’: {rvest}, {rlang} and {rstudioapi} (‘r’ not pronounced as ‘arr’ in any of these)\nthe trouble with ‘read’: {readr} and {readxl} (‘reed’ becomes ‘ree-add’ because the whole thing is being read as one word)\nspelled out: {vctrs} (rather than ‘vectors’ in a New Zealand accent)\nwhat the actual heck: {ttdo} (I think it tries to pronounce the whole thing)\n\nAnd what about {dplyr}? Well, it was something like ‘d’pleur’. I’m pretty sure that’s not quite right.\nOf course, there are other text-to-speech engines, which may interpret and synthesise words differently. For example, espeak vocalises {dplyr} as ‘deepler’ which is definitely not right.\nIf you’re a user of assistive technology, does the way the machine reads the package names impact your pronunciation of the package name?"

    "text": "Data: animal rescues\nI’ve found an interesting example dataset that contains eastings and northings: animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade from the excellent London Data Store. In their words:\n\nThe London Fire Brigade attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call ‘special services’). These ‘special services’ include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress.\n\nThis is close to my heart because a pigeon fell down our chimney recently. After a brave rescue mission (putting on some rubber gloves and contorting my arms through a tiny vent hole) I think I’m now qualified to join an elite search and rescue team.\n\nClean\nWe can read the data directly from the datastore as a CSV file.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nlibrary(janitor, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\n\ncsv_path &lt;- \"https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/01007433-55c2-4b8a-b799-626d9e3bc284/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv\"\n\nrescue &lt;- read_csv(csv_path, show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n# A sample of the rows and columns\nrescue %&gt;%\n  select(DateTimeOfCall, `IncidentNotionalCost(£)`, AnimalGroupParent, Borough) %&gt;%\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  DateTimeOfCall      `IncidentNotionalCost(£)` AnimalGroupParent     Borough   \n  &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 2020-06-14 12:05:00 346                       Bird                  WESTMINST…\n2 2022-12-31 18:53:00 728                       Cat                   BRENT     \n3 2017-06-16 21:19:00 328                       Cat                   SOUTHWARK \n4 2022-07-17 12:41:00 728                       Unknown - Wild Animal HARROW    \n5 2018-04-08 10:36:00 333                       Cat                   WALTHAM F…\n\n\nSo each row is an ‘incident’ to which the brigade were called and there’s 9728 of them recorded in the dataset.

I’ve added an interactive table below so you can search for incidents, creatures, locations and the notional cost of the callout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously there are plenty of cats up trees, but there’s so much more. Some of the more unique entries are:\n\nDOG WITH JAW TRAPPED IN MAGAZINE RACK\n\n\nSWAN IN DISTRESS\n\n\nFERRET STUCK IN LIFT SHAFT\n\nAnd of course:\n\nTWO DOGS IN TOILET ELDERLY LADY INVOLVED"

    "text": "Data: points\nEach incident in our data is a point in space with an X and Y coordinate. It’s currently eastings and northings, but we want to transform it to latitude and longitude.\n\nThe sf class and reprojection\nA Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is required to project geographic entities – points, polygons, etc – onto a surface. There are many systems for doing this, from local to global, each with its own CRS code. This isn’t a post about geography and projections, but you can read more in the CRS chapter of rspatial.org.\nFirst we convert the our dataframe-class object an ‘sf’ class object using the st_as_sf function, which readies it for spatial analysis. We simply provide arguments that point to the columns containing the coordinates and the CRS code for that projection system.\nWe can then use the st_transform() function to convert our projection system from eastings and northings to to latitude and longitude.\n\nlibrary(sf, quietly = TRUE)\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.11.0, GDAL 3.5.3, PROJ 9.1.0; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\nrescue_sf &lt;- rescue %&gt;% \n  st_as_sf(\n    coords = c(\"Easting_rounded\", \"Northing_rounded\"),\n    crs = 27700  # coordinate reference system code for eastings/northings\n  ) %&gt;% \n  st_transform(crs = 4326)  # the coord ref system code for latlong\n\nSo what happened more specifically? Our eastings and northings were combined with st_as_sf() into a two element list-column called geometry with data type sfc_POINT. Our new sf-class object also contains some metadata detailing the geometry type – POINTS in our case – and the projection system of the coordinate data, which we converted to latlong with the st_transform() function.\n\n\nTidyverse manipulation\nAs mentioned, one advantage of using {sf} is that sf-class objects use the tidy data paradigm that allows for use of the tidyverse. Some users may prefer this relative to the ‘Spatial Points Data Frame’ (SPDF) class that is produced by the {sp} package for points data. SPDFs are an S4 class, which means they have ‘slots’ of data, coordinates, etc.\nIn the code chunk above I used pipes to pass the rescue dataframe to st_as_sf() and then to st_transform(). You can also use {dplyr} functions like filter() on your sf-class object.\n\nfiltered_rescue_sf &lt;- rescue_sf %&gt;%\n  filter(\n    AnimalGroupParent %in% c(\"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Bird\"),  # just these animals\n    DateTimeOfCall &gt; ymd(\"2017-01-01\") &\n      DateTimeOfCall &lt; ymd(\"2017-12-31\")  # 2017 only\n  )\n\nWe can also use the st_coordinates() function to extract the XY (latitude and longitude) coordinates from the column containing our {sf} point geometry. This means we can have separate columns for the latitude and longitude, as well as our list-column.\n\nrescue_coords &lt;- as.data.frame(st_coordinates(filtered_rescue_sf))\nfiltered_rescue_sf &lt;- bind_cols(filtered_rescue_sf, rescue_coords)"

The outcome is very similar to what we had for our points data.\n\n\nScrape London boroughs\nBut which of these LADs are London boroughs?

    "text": "Send a cartogram\nIt’s usually best to scale subnational divisions by voter count when visualising election results. This is because election outcomes are decided by people, not land area. Cartograms are a good choice for this: they’re maps where geographic units are resized according to something other than area.\nOne format of the cartogram is the tilegram. Tilegrams disregard the shape of the geographic units entirely and represent them with uniformly-shaped ‘tiles’ instead. Squares are often used, but hexagons give you a bit more freedom to pack the units and approximate geographic location. Hexagons are the bestagons, after all.\nA tilegram may end up looking strange if you’re used to looking at Mercator-projected maps, but it’s a better reflection of relative voter contribution."

    "text": "Back to college\nSo we could make a tilegram of the recent US presidential election with a separate shape for each state. Right? Well, yeah, but there’s a better way.\nThe US presidential election is special because the total vote count doesn’t directly elect the leader. Instead there’s an ‘electoral college’ system. Put extremely simply, each state has a number of representatives (‘electors’) that are sent to vote for the candidate that got the majority vote share in their state. The winning national candidate has the majority of state electors declaring for them (270 of 538).\nSo it’s electors, not states, that should be represented by each unit in a tilegram of US presidential election results."

Karambelkar has an sf_FiveThirtyEightElectoralCollege2 object that contains tilegram data for the US where each elector is represented by one hexagon.\nIt’s an sf-class object, which means it contains tidy geospatial information: each row is an elector, with a column for the state abbreviation and a column for the hexagon geometries.\nBefore we take a look, let’s load the packages used in this post.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  # Data wrangling\n  library(dplyr)       # data manipulation\n  library(stringr)     # string manipulation\n  # Mapping\n  library(tilegramsR)  # tilegram objects\n  library(ggplot2)     # plotting\n  library(ggtext)      # text rendering in plots\n  library(ggthemes)    # has a map theme\n  library(patchwork)   # organise plots\n})\n\nThe default print method for sf-class objects shows us a few things. We can see there are 538 two-dimensional shapes: one for each elector. Note that this map is built in arbitrary space: the bounding box doesn’t reflect actual geography and there’s no coordinate reference system (CRS). The preview of the features shows us each row of the dataset with each state labelled with its abbreviation (CA is California, for example).\n\nsf_FiveThirtyEightElectoralCollege\n\nSimple feature collection with 538 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 293.6239 ymin: 16.95238 xmax: 2495.803 ymax: 1661.333\nCRS:           NA\nFirst 10 features:\n   FID state tilegramVa                       geometry\n1   02    AK          3 POLYGON ((293.6239 237.3333...\n2   06    CA         55 POLYGON ((352.3486 847.619,...\n3   06    CA         55 POLYGON ((322.9862 796.7619...\n4   06    CA         55 POLYGON ((352.3486 745.9048...\n5   06    CA         55 POLYGON ((322.9862 695.0476...\n6   06    CA         55 POLYGON ((352.3486 644.1905...\n7   02    AK          3 POLYGON ((322.9862 288.1905...\n8   02    AK          3 POLYGON ((352.3486 237.3333...\n9   06    CA         55 POLYGON ((411.0734 949.3333...\n10  06    CA         55 POLYGON ((381.711 898.4762,...\n\n\nSimilarly, there’s an object called sf_FiveThirtyEightElectoralCollege.states that contains geometry to delineate state boundaries in the sf_FiveThirtyEightElectoralCollege object. We can combine these and look at a quick tilegram of the US electoral college using {ggplot2} and the special geom_sf() geom for visualising geospatial data stored in sf format.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_sf(data = sf_FiveThirtyEightElectoralCollege) + \n  geom_sf(\n    data = sf_FiveThirtyEightElectoralCollege.states,\n    color = \"black\", alpha = 0, size = 1\n  ) + \n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that each elector is represented by a single hexagon and groups of hexagons are combined into states (thick outlines). Hexagons are placed roughly in the familiar shape of the US despite the change to the apparent area of each one. The non-contiguous regions in the lower left are Alaska (three electors) and Hawaii (four)."

These states use the ‘congressional district method’.\nThe popular-vote winner gets two electors by default and the remaining electors are won by the winner of the popular vote in each district (three in Nebraska and two in Maine).

Sometimes a few swear words will be thrown in for good measure (look no further than ‘Developers Swearing’ on Twitter).\nThe more obvious problem from reading the commits for this blog is my incessant keyboard mashing; I think a lot of my commits are there to fix typos.1\nSo I’ve prepared a little R function to grab the commit messages for a specified repo and find the ones that contain a given search term, like ‘typo’.2"

    "text": "Search commits\n{gh} is a handy R package from Gábor Csárdi, Jenny Bryan and Hadley Wickham that we can use to interact with GitHub’s REST API.3 We can also use {purrr} for iterating over the returned API object.\n\nlibrary(gh)    # CRAN v1.2.0\nlibrary(purrr) # CRAN v0.3.4\n\nSo, here’s one way of forming a function to search commit messages:\n\nsearch_commits &lt;- function(owner, repo, string = \"typo\") {\n  \n  commits &lt;- gh::gh(\n    \"GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits\",\n    owner = owner, repo = repo,\n    .limit = Inf\n  )\n\n  messages &lt;- purrr::map_chr(\n    commits, ~purrr::pluck(.x, \"commit\", \"message\")\n  )\n  \n  matches &lt;- messages[grepl(string, messages, ignore.case = TRUE)]\n  \n  out &lt;- list(\n    meta = list(owner, repo),\n    counts = list(\n      match_count = length(matches),\n      commit_count = length(messages),\n      match_ratio = length(matches) / length(messages)\n    ),\n    matches = matches,\n    messages = messages\n  )\n  \n  return(out)\n  \n}\n\nFirst we pass a GET request to the GitHub API via gh::gh(). The API documentation tells us the form needed to get commits for a given owner’s repo.\nBeware: the API returns results in batches of some maximum size, but the .limit = Inf argument automatically creates additional requests until everything is returned. That might mean a lot of API calls.\nNext we can use {purrr} to iteratively pluck() out the commit messages from the list returned by gh::gh(). It’s then a case of finding which ones contain a search string of interest (defaulting to the word ‘typo’).\nThe object returned by search_commits() is a list with four elements: meta repeats the user and repo names; counts is a list with the commit count, the count of messages containing the search term, and their ratio; and the messages and matches elements contain all messages and the ones containing the search term, respectively."

There’s a real, obtainable, minimum level of effort that will get you to a thing that works.\nConsider that in the context of writing blog posts for yourself. They only have to be good enough to remind you of what you did so you can redo the thing at some point in the future.\nThis will also encourage you to keep it short and simple. You’re far more likely to finish it that way. Write a follow-up later if you want to.\n\n\n3. There are others like you\nR solves so many problems efficiently and reproducibly. It’s particularly needed in the public sector, where I work, to build trust, reduce costs and do things quicker. I think there are plenty of people in this boat; why else are you reading this?\nI’m not a ‘programmer’, however. I wasn’t specifically trained in statistics. I definitely didn’t ‘get’ R at first and I’m probably never going to be an ‘expert’. So I might as well keep learning and sharing.\nBeing visible with your learning means that others can help you and give you ideas. Being open might even encourage other learners to get involved, too.\nConsider people like Sharla Gelfand and David Keyes (of R for the Rest of Us), who are visible on Twitter and unafraid of asking questions. One of R’s unique selling points is its friendly community. Make the most of it.\nUltimately, you don’t owe anything to anyone. But there are other people like you. Why not learn in the open and help lower the barrier to entry?"

The documentation, README and blog post provide this information, as well as DeSandro’s resources, but it would be ideal to have an option to showcase {dehex} and learn stuff without needing to type any functions yourself.\nSo, I’ve created a simple Shiny app and made it available as the dh_app() function in {dehex}.2 I consider it ‘in development’ (this absolves me of liability if I say this, yes?).\nThe app depends on two packages: {shiny} and {bslib}. You’ll have to install these separately to {dehex} by using install.packages(c(\"shiny\", \"bslib\")) (if you haven’t already installed them on your machine).\nThese aren’t dependencies3 because you shouldn’t be forced to install them if you have no plans on using the app.4\nAside: what’s fun is I get to make further use of the Shiny app README badge I invented (?) with my {badgr} package, like so:"

As you get better, you may not need to reveal them anymore.\nThe final tab provides the solution. You should have the answer by the time you get to this tab, but it reveals to you the hue, saturation and lightness RGB profiles that best match the generated hex code, along with the answer as a string, and a sample of the colour itself.\nThe app is purposefully low on interactivity. It’s just a little sidequest that bundles the steps and relevant {dehex} functions, in case you don’t want to run the functions from R itself.5\nOriginally I was going to just create an app to go on the web for anyone to use, but why would they want to see outputs from {dehex}?

You can find them in the docs/ folder:\ndocs/\n├── encrypt-test.Rmd\n├── encrypt-test.html\n├── encrypt-test.enc.html\n└── encrypt-test.enc.html.key\nI told GitHub Pages to serve this docs/ folder from the main branch, so that the URL ends up as https://matt-dray.github.io/encrypt-rmd-test/encrypt-test.html.enc.html.3\nNow I can share the URL with someone and send them the key via a separate means of communication, like via a fax or a pigeon."

We provided feedback to help each other improve and engage better with learners.\nWe ran the demo twice each: the first time was relatively cold with little preparation, but for the second attempt we had a chance to react to the feedback and to think about the teaching demo assessment rubric.\n\nSanding the rough edges\nI chose to do the ‘exploring data frames’ episode of the R for Reproducible Scientific Research lesson of Software Carpentry.\nPositive feedback from my first attempt included that I:\n\nmade sure everyone could see what was on my screen and it was at a sufficient zoom level (I had reset RStudio to its defaults because this is what beginners would see)\ngave the learning objectives and recap of the previous session to remind people what we were doing and what we had done already\nexecuted code line by line at an appropriate speed with clear instructions\n\nSome points to improve upon where that I:\n\ndidn’t say out loud the keyboard shortcut that I was using to execute the lines\nsaid that the c() function was for ‘concatenating’ elements into vectors, which is a word that some people may not be familiar with\nused the word ‘simply’ when describing how to do something, a phrase that could undermine a learner’s progress if they aren’t able to complete that task (a case of an ‘expert blind spot’, as discussed in the ‘expertise and instruction’ lesson of the workshop)\n\n\n\nNailing it\nI reacted to the feedback to help improve things for my second live-coding demo. For example, I:\n\nsaid out-loud every action I was doing, including physical key presses when necessary (e.g. “and run this line with the command and enter shortcut”)\navoided phrases like ‘simply do this’ and ‘just do that’\nsaid that the ‘c’ in the c() function means to ‘combine’ rather than to ‘concatenate’2\n\nI also did a couple of extra things:\n\nadded three lines of comments at the top of the file to explain the objectives and goals\npre-loaded an object into the environment (they learnt how to do this in the previous session) to avoid a slightly awkward explanation at the beginning\nexpanded my RStudio window so more code be seen at once\n\nThe second attempt was well-received, thanks to feedback and a greater appreciation of the audience’s needs."

I just watched some grainy YouTube videos and roughly guessed where the players were.\nA really nice interactive tool that makes the process easier is the soccer event logger by Ben Torvaney, creator of {ggsoccer}.\n\nPlayers\nThe first data frame contains each player’s coordinates, with a row for each frame of the final animation. I added the player name so it could be used as a label.\nI chose to focus on the three active players in the build-up to the goal. This made the final graphic clearer, yes, but more importantly it meant I had fewer data points to input.\nI created the data frame using tribble() from the {tibble} package because I found it easier to input the data in a row-wise fashion.

It’s also popular in the maker community given its support for various peripherals like cameras and sensors.\nThe Pi was first released in 2012 and is now in its fourth generation of hardware. I was gifted a Pi 2 Model B in 2015 and have used it intermittently as a secondary computer and a video game emulation machine.\nI decided to pull my Pi out of retirement to explore how well it could run R, and more specifically, be used as a machine for blogging.\n\n\nRaspberry Pi OS\nThe Raspberry Pi is capable of running a large number of operating systems. The go-to is Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), built on the open-source Debian Linux distribution.\nYou need to install the OS onto a micro-SD card1 via a second computer and then insert it into your Pi. Installing the Raspberry Pi Imager to your second computer will help you format (clean) the card and install the OS. At the time of writing, this was the May 2020 release.\nThere’s a full walkthrough for setting up your machine on the Raspberry Pi website."

Things may change over time, but the sections below describe what worked at time of writing. I’ve added software version numbers below for posterity.\nYou can click to jump to each section:\n\n1. Install R and an IDE\n\n1a. Install R\n1b. Install Neovim\n1c. Install Nvim-R\n\n2. Install blogging requirements\n\n2a. Install {blogdown}\n2b. Install Pandoc\n2c. Install Hugo\n\n\nIn each case, we’ll be running commands from the Terminal to install what we need.2\nBefore installing things, it’s a good idea to run the update command so that the latest package versions are installed\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n1. Install R and an IDE\nIt’s not too tricky to get hold of R, but what coding environment can we use?\nI typically use the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE), but it isn’t available on this platform3. You could just run R from the Terminal, but it’s tedious to work entirely from the command line or copy-paste commands to it from a text editor.\nThis is where Nvim-R comes in. It turns your Terminal into an IDE.4\n\n1a. Install R\nR can be installed from the command line with:\n\nsudo apt-get install r-base r-base-core r-base-dev\n\nThis grabs the latest R version that’s available for the platform, which is 3.5. At time of writing, version 4.0 has been released on other platforms, so we’ll miss out on the latest advancements like stringsAsFactors=FALSE by default, sadly.\n\n\n1b. Install Neovim\nA prerequisite for Nvim-R is either Vim or Neovim. Nvim-R is a plugin for these tools.\nBut what are they, actually? Vim is a powerful text editor for the command line and Neovim is effectively a more extensible version of it.\nI’ve been using Neovim, which can be installed with:\n\nsudo apt install neovim\n\nAt time of writing, this installs version 0.3.4. You can enter Neovim by opening a terminal and running nvim. This puts you into a text editor interface.\n\n\n1c. Install Nvim-R\n\n\n\nNvim-R running in Terminal. Script up top, console below.\n\n\nThere are a whole bunch of plugins available for Neovim to help extend it. You can see these at the VimAwesome site.\nNvim-R by Jakson Alves de Aquino is one such plugin.\nAt the simplest level, Nvim-R turns your terminal into an R IDE by allowing for a concurrent script editor and console (along with many other features). This means you can write R code and send it to the console without having to copy-paste or write directly into the console. This is analagous to something like RStudio without the point-and-click features.\n\nvim-plug and Nvim-R\nWe can install a plugin manager to help install and manage Nvim-R and other Neovim extensions: vim-plug by Junegunn Choi.\nHaving installed Neovim, you can get vim-plug by running this via Terminal:\n\nsh -c 'curl -fLo \"${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}\"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \\\n       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'\n\nYou specify your plugins in a special init.vim file. Run the following line to create the file and open it in Neovim in the Terminal so you can begin editing:\n\nnvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim\n\nYou can then toggle into Neovim’s ‘insert’ mode (press i) and paste (ctrl + shift + V) this in:\n\n\" Specify a directory for plugins\n\" - Avoid using standard Vim directory names like 'plugin'\ncall plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')\n\n\" List of plugins.\n\" Make sure you use single quotes\n\n\" Shorthand notation\nPlug 'jalvesaq/Nvim-R', {'branch': 'stable'}\n\n\" Initialize plugin system\ncall plug#end()\n\nWhere Plug 'jalvesaq/Nvim-R' is the part where the Nvim-R plugin is specified.\nThis is a super minimal init.vim example. You can add a whole bunch of other plugins to this list that will allow for things like code autocompletion and themes. You can also add lines to this file to modify various settings within Neovim.\nEnter ‘normal’ mode (press Esc) and then type the following and hit Enter:\n\n:PluginInstall\n\nThis triggers the installation of the plugins you specified in the init.vim file. For me, this installed the latest Nvim-R version, 0.9.14.\nI found a YouTube video and a GitHub gist by Rohit Farmer really useful for doing these steps. Rohit provides some good examples of additional plugins that will improve your experience of Nvim-R.\n\n\nUsing Nvim-R\nA full run-through of how to use Neovim and Nvim-R are out of scope for this post, but it’s worth a quick aside here.\nTo open an .R or .Rmd script for editing in Nvim-R, you can:\n\ntype nvim and the path to your file, like nvim ~/path/to/file.R, from a Terminal\nright-click the file in the explorer and select ‘Nvim-R’, which will open that file in Nvim-R in a Terminal window\n\nThe important thing to know is that Neovim and Nvim-R are keyboard-driven; there’s no pointing-and-clicking like in RStudio. You’ll need to remember a bunch of non-obvious key presses to get around, although these are all configurable.\nSee Neovim’s docs for its key bindings (i.e. key presses that result in something happening), but here’s some useful ones:\n\ni to enter ‘insert’ mode and begin typing text\nEsc to exit insert mode and enter ‘normal’ mode\n:w and Enter to write (save)\n:q and Enter to quit (the most searched-for command in history?) or :q! to quit without saving\n:wq and Enter to save and quit\n^W and one of l, k, j or h to move focus around the ‘panes’ (e.g. script to console)\n\nAs for Nvim-R, see Section 4 of the docs for a full set of key bindings. Here’s some important default ones:\n\n\\rf opens a console\n\\l sends the current line to the console\n\\cc to send the current R Markdown chunk\n\\ro to open and close the object browser\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Install blogging requirements\nNow we’ve got everything we need to use R on the Raspberry Pi. My use case involves blogging, so now to install the requirements for that.\n\n2a. Install {blogdown}\nI used Yihui Xie’s {blogdown} package to build this blog and post to it.\nYou can install the package (currently v0.20) from CRAN. I found that I had to install {httpuv} separately first to prevent errors.\nYou can run this from Nvim-R or you can run R to start R from a Terminal window.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"httpuv\", \"blogdown\"))\n\nOf course, you can go ahead and install any other packages you might need to write your posts.\nBut we also need two further things that aren’t R packages: Pandoc and Hugo.\n\n\n2b. Install Pandoc\n{blogdown} is based on turning R Markdown files into HTML files to be served as a website. A crucial element of this conversion process is a document converter called Pandoc. It can be installed via the Terminal with:\n\nsudo apt-get install pandoc\n\nThis installed version 2.2.1 at time of writing.\n\n\n2c. Install Hugo\nHugo is a static-site generator that builds your posts into a website, like the one you’re looking at now.\nYou can install Hugo from within R with blogdown::install_hugo(), but this failed for me because it tries to install a 64-bit version and Raspberry Pi OS is 32-bit.\nInstead, I used snapcraft, which describes itself as ‘the app store for Linux’. It bundles up everything you need for a given installation, including dependencies. This is great for a noob like me.\nTo enable the installation of ‘snaps’, you first need to run:\n\nsudo apt install snapd\n\nAfter a reboot, install the Hugo snap:\n\nsudo snap install hugo\n\nThis installed version 0.73.0 for me at time of writing."

    "text": "It’s a trapinch\nSo, I’ve created the {trapinch} package.\nIt’s a proof of concept; a work in progress. There’s probably bugs. I’m sharing it in case I don’t take it any further, or if you want to contribute an issue or pull request.\nYou can download it from GitHub. It depends on {httr2} (obviously), {rcurl} and R version 4.1 or higher4 and can be downloaded from GitHub:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/trapinch\")  # v0.0.1 in this post\nlibrary(trapinch)\n\nDon’t be surprised if function names or general functionality change in future. In particular, I’d like to look at throttling (limiting the number of API calls to prevent misuse) and to provide sensible errors for timeouts or if the service is down.\n\nGotta GET ’em all\nThere’s a generic low-level function, get_pokeapi(), to which you pass the endpoint and resource ID (numeric) or name (character) of interest. Each endpoint also has its own dedicated function, like get_item() or get_move() that calls get_pokeapi() under the hood.\nYou can look at the inbuilt resource_lookups list to get a dataframe of resource IDs and names for each endpoint, as well as the full URL needed to query the API. Here’s the first few:\n\nhead(names(resource_lookups))\n\n[1] \"ability\"        \"berry\"          \"berry-firmness\" \"berry-flavor\"  \n[5] \"characteristic\" \"contest-effect\"\nSo here’s the first few rows of the resource dataframe for the ‘pokemon’ endpoint:\n\nhead(resource_lookups[[\"pokemon\"]])\n\n  id       name                                  url\n1  1  bulbasaur https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/\n2  2    ivysaur https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/\n3  3   venusaur https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/3/\n4  4 charmander https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4/\n5  5 charmeleon https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/5/\n6  6  charizard https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/6/\nOne of these resource names is ‘mew’, the legendary first-generation Pokémon.5 You could use get_pokeapi(\"pokemon\", \"mew\") to retrieve its data, or more simply:\n\nmew &lt;- get_pokemon(\"mew\")\n\nThe function returns a list of lists, which is parsed from the JSON response returned by the API. So for the ‘pokemon’ endpoint we get 18 different elements of various classes:\n\nstr(mew, max.level = 1)\n\nList of 18\n $ abilities               :List of 1\n $ base_experience         : int 300\n $ forms                   :List of 1\n $ game_indices            :List of 20\n $ height                  : int 4\n $ held_items              :List of 1\n $ id                      : int 151\n $ is_default              : logi TRUE\n $ location_area_encounters: chr \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/151/encounters\"\n $ moves                   :List of 363\n $ name                    : chr \"mew\"\n $ order                   : int 248\n $ past_types              : list()\n $ species                 :List of 2\n $ sprites                 :List of 10\n $ stats                   :List of 6\n $ types                   :List of 1\n $ weight                  : int 40\nI’ve shown only the top level structure to hide some of the complexity. For example, the ‘moves’ item contains all the moves a Pokémon can learn, at what level it can learn them, in which game it learns them, and so on. Grabbing the first of the 363 ‘moves’ items (!) listed for Mew looks like this (oof):\n\nmew[[\"moves\"]][[1]][[\"move\"]][[\"name\"]]\n\n[1] \"pound\"\nA future task might be to simplify some of this complexity by collapsing deep lists into dataframes where possible.\n\n\nThumbing the Pokédex\nThe API responses are ‘paged’, meaning that you must make successive requests of a set size to retrieve all the data for a given endpoint. The get_*() functions automatically expand the request to ask for all the items in one go.\nWe know the maximum number of items to be returned from an endpoint because the stored in the resource_lookups object, so this can be appended automatically to the request string.\n\n\nBILL’s PC\nResponses are cached, which means that the data is saved on your computer. If you make the same request, the data will be retrieved first from the cache rather than calling the API again. That means there’s one less request for the API to deal with.\nThe cache is the path resolved by R_user_dir(\"trapinch\", \"cache\"). This function was introduced in R v4.0 for platform-independent storage of package-related data on a user’s machine.6 You can delete everything from the cache with clear_cache().\n\n\nSubstitute\n{httptest2} is a handy package that lets you test code written with {httr2}, specifically.\nWhy would you need special testing for API calls? The idea is that you should be able to test your package without the need for an active internet connection. {httptest2} ‘records’ the calls you make when you run your tests, then chooses when testing between this ‘mock’ response and a ‘live’ response.\nThe approach is pretty simple if you’ve tested before with {testthat}: you wrap your normal test_that() call with httr2::with_mock_dir(). Here’s an example of a test that make sure we get a list back from the API when we use get_pokeapi():\n\nwith_mock_dir(\"endpoint\", {\n  test_that(\"a list is returned\", {\n    expect_type(get_pokeapi(\"move-battle-style\"), \"list\")\n  })\n})\n\nBy wrapping the test in with_mock_dir(), {httptest2} creates the directory tests/endpoint/ that stores a copy of the JSON returned for this call when an internet connection was live.\nAs an aside, I learnt about curl::has_internet() in Colin’s blogpost, which can stop() the get_*() functions if there’s no internet connection. But has_internet() will trigger if you’re offline when you test, defeating the purpose of {httptest2}! Luckily, I saw a timely post by Maëlle about integrating this type of check into an ‘escape hatch’ so your unit tests can be run successfully in this scenario.\nThe rOpenSci HTTP Testing book is a good general port of call as well."

I could leave it at that.\nBut how daunting does the underlying {httr2} code look in the back-end? Turns out that it’s not that scary, thanks to those friendly and modular functions of {httr2}.\nWe can walk through that earlier get_pokemon(\"mew\") call using bare {httr2} functions by:\n\nStarting with the base API URL\nAppending the endpoint and resource as extensions (i.e. in the form /pokemon/mew)\nAdding a query for the maximum number of items in this endpoint-resource combo (i.e. ?limit=1279)\nAnnouncing to the API, as courtesy, who has made the call (i.e. who is the ‘user agent’)\nSpecifying the cache location for results to be saved\n\nFirst some variables:\n\nendpoint &lt;- \"pokemon\"\nresource &lt;- \"mew\"\nbase_url &lt;- \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/\"\nuser_agent &lt;- \"trapinch (http://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch)\"\nresource_count &lt;- nrow(trapinch::resource_lookups[[endpoint]])\ncache_dir &lt;- tools::R_user_dir(\"trapinch\", which = \"cache\")\n\nAnd now we can build our request with {httr2} functions prefixed with req:\n\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nmew_request &lt;- request(base_url) |&gt;\n  req_url_path_append(endpoint, resource) |&gt;\n  req_url_query(limit = resource_count) |&gt;\n  req_user_agent(user_agent) |&gt;\n  req_cache(cache_dir)\n\nPrinting the object summarises the request:\n\nmew_request\n\n&lt;httr2_request&gt;\nGET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/mew?limit=1279\nBody: empty\nOptions:\n• useragent: 'trapinch (http://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch)'\nPolicies:\n• cache_path: '/Users/mattdray/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/trapinch'\n• cache_use_on_error: FALSE\n• cache_debug: FALSE\nThen we can actually execute the request:\n\nmew_perform &lt;- req_perform(mew_request)\n\nAgain, we can peek at the object to get some extra information about the processing of the request:\n\nmew_perform\n\n&lt;httr2_response&gt;\nGET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/mew?limit=1279\nStatus: 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nBody: In memory (561317 bytes)\nWe can see the request was successful, since the HTTP status was 200 OK. Other status values are possible and may require us to try again later, for example.\nA couple of functions to mention here are last_request() and last_response(), which will also (surprise!) spit out info about the last request you made and the response received.\nFinally we can parse the JSON returned by the API. Again, I’m presenting the top-level structure only, given its complexity:\n\nmew_response &lt;- resp_body_json(mew_perform)\nstr(mew_response, max.level = 1)\n\nList of 18\n $ abilities               :List of 1\n $ base_experience         : int 300\n $ forms                   :List of 1\n $ game_indices            :List of 20\n $ height                  : int 4\n $ held_items              :List of 1\n $ id                      : int 151\n $ is_default              : logi TRUE\n $ location_area_encounters: chr \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/151/encounters\"\n $ moves                   :List of 363\n $ name                    : chr \"mew\"\n $ order                   : int 248\n $ past_types              : list()\n $ species                 :List of 2\n $ sprites                 :List of 10\n $ stats                   :List of 6\n $ types                   :List of 1\n $ weight                  : int 40\nBoom: this matches the information we retrieved earlier with get_pokemon(\"mew\")."

There exist R wrappers like UBC-MDS’s {pokedex} and Eva Nguyen’s {pokeWrapper}, but these appear smaller in scope and haven’t been updated for a while. (Edit: as noted at the top of this post, see also Ash Baldry’s {httr2}-powered {pokeapi} package, which I had somehow missed!)↩︎\nThere’s one exception: for Pokémon encounters you need the form /pokemon/{resource}/encounters. The get_pokeapi() function handles this extension with a third argument, ext, which is pre-filled with the string \"encounters\" in the get_pokemon_location_areas() function, so you don’t have to think about it.↩︎\nThis is entirely because I wanted to use tools::R_user_dir() for caching, which was introduced in v4.0. And if we’re depending on v4.0, why not bump to v4.1 and use the base pipe, |&gt;?↩︎\nI’ll say it: the original Japanese Red/Green Mew sprite was baller. Battle me.↩︎\nI made a mockery of R_user_dir’s functionality in my toy package {tamRgo}, which uses the location to store data for a persistent cyberpet (like a Tamagotchi) that you can interact with in the R console.↩︎\nI have history with this: my {dialga} package is named for the legendary ‘temporal’ Pokémon from the Diamond and Pearl games, which is fitting because the package converts between R code, cron strings and English.↩︎\nRepokémon-Driven Development.↩︎"

I’ve built out a bit of a ‘game loop’, but it’s just for fun and the code is not optimised. Bugs guaranteed, so suggestions and code contributions are always welcome.\n\n\nNew pet\nTo begin, you’ll need to generate you new cyberpet5 by laying an egg. You’ll be asked to confirm it’s okay to save a blueprint file onto your computer, which is just a small list object stored as an RDS file.\n\nlay_egg(pet_name = \"KEVIN\")\n\nSave pet blueprint? y/n: y\nSaved pet blueprint.\nYou have a new egg... it hatched!\nYou can get_stats(), see_pet(), play(), feed(), clean().\nThe blueprint will be saved at the location resolved by tools::R_user_dir(\"tamRgo\", \"data\"). You can always release() your pet into the wild, which will delete the blueprint file.\nSo, you have a new pet. Now what? The hint suggests to check the stats, so let’s do that.\n\nget_stats()\n\nCharacteristics\n Name:    KEVIN\n Species: Z\n Age:     0\n Level:   0 (newborn)\n Alive:   TRUE\nStatus\n Happy:   ■■■□□  \n Hungry:  ■■■□□  \n Dirty:   □□□□□  \nYou can see some characteristics: the name you provided, the pet’s species (X, Y or Z) and their age (days since ‘birth’). You can see the pet’s level (whatever that means) and whether they are currently alive. There’s also status values, which are followed by five-point gauges, some of which are filled.\nLet’s quickly check what our pet looks like with see_pet(). Its appearance depends on the species and the level; newborns are pretty much a blob, but your pet will grow and develop as it levels.\nThe rendering of the sprite, which is built with unicode block elements, will depend on the settings in your console. Your browser may also bork the the sprites as they appear in this post. See the package’s hex logo at the top of the page to get truer examples of the intended designs.\n\nsee_pet()\n\n░░░░░░░\n░░███░░\n░█░█░█░\n░█████░\n░██░██░\n░░███░░\n░░░░░░░\nCongratulations! KEVIN is a beautiful little chap.\n\n\nFeed\nHaving just been born, KEVIN is a bit peckish. You can tell because the ‘Hungry’ gauge is partially filled. Let’s lower the value by using feed().\n\nfeed()\n\n'Hungry' status value is now 2/5\nSee how the ‘Hungry’ counter decreased by 1 to 2?\n\nget_stats()\n\nCharacteristics\n  Name:    KEVIN\n  Species: Z\n  Age:     0\n  Level:   0 (newborn)\n  Alive:   TRUE\nStatus\n  Happy:   ■■■□□  \n  Hungry:  ■■□□□  \n  Dirty:   □□□□□  \n\n\nPlay\nYou can increase the ‘Happy’ value, which is currently 0, with play(). This begins a game of ‘higher or lower’ with user input. Yes, it’s not much of a skill-based game, but there’s a rumour that it’s easier under some circumstances and that a higher score is better for your pet’s wellbeing.\n\nplay()\n\nHigher or lower than 4? Type h or l: h\nWrong! It was 1. Score: 0/5.\nHigher or lower than 1? Type h or l: h\nCorrect! It was 8. Score: 1/5.\nHigher or lower than 4? Type h or l: h\nCorrect! It was 6. Score: 2/5.\nHigher or lower than 6? Type h or l: l\nCorrect! It was 5. Score: 3/5.\nHigher or lower than 7? Type h or l: l\nWrong! It was 10. Score: 3/5.\nResult: you scored 3/5!\n'Happy' status value is now 4/5\n\n\nClean\nAfter some time, your pet will become ‘dirty’, represented by a small pile of filth underneath their sprite.\n\nsee_pet()\n\n░░░░░░░\n░░███░░\n░█░█░█░\n░█████░\n░██░██░\n░░███░░\n░░░░░░░\n░░░░░░░\n░░░█░░░\n░░███░░  \n░█████░ \n░░░░░░░\nWhich is almost as big as KEVIN himself, wow. You’ll just need to clean() it away.\n\nclean()\n\n'Dirty' status value is now 0/5\n\n\nPersistence\nPerhaps the most important thing to know is that you can end your R session and come back later and your pet will still be available. In fact, it will continue to live and grow on your computer while you’re away.\nMaybe you come back five days later. Here’s what you might see if you check your pet’s stats from any R session on your computer.\n\nget_stats()\n\nCharacteristics\n  Name:    KEVIN\n  Species: Z\n  Age:     5\n  Level:   2 (youngling)\n  Alive:   TRUE\nStatus\n  Happy:   □□□□□ !\n  Hungry:  ■■■■■ !\n  Dirty:   ■■■■■ !\nAha, so KEVIN’s age and level have increased since you’ve been away, even though you haven’t interacted with him for a while. But uh-oh, looks like his status values are at their worst.\nPay attention to these status values. Look after your pet! Apparently there’s a chance it might become… ‘unalive’. Rumour has it that good owners have longer-living pets…\nAnyway, let’s quickly check KEVIN’s appearance now he’s level 2.\n\nsee_pet()\n\n░░░░░░░░░░\n░░█░░░░█░░\n░░░█░░█░░░\n░░██████░░\n░░█░██░█░░\n░░██████░░\n░███░░███░\n░░██████░░\n░░█░░░░█░░\n░░░░░░░░░░\n░░░░░░░\n░░░█░░░\n░░███░░  \n░█████░ \n░░░░░░░\n░░░░░░░\n░░░█░░░\n░░███░░  \n░█████░ \n░░░░░░░\n░░░░░░░\n░░░█░░░\n░░███░░  \n░█████░ \n░░░░░░░\n░░░░░░░\n░░░█░░░\n░░███░░  \n░█████░ \n░░░░░░░\n░░░░░░░\n░░░█░░░\n░░███░░  \n░█████░ \n░░░░░░░\nErm, well, cool antennae, bro.

    "text": "Under the shell\nThe underlying logic is pretty simple. I don’t want to give away too many spoilers, but it’s worth explaining some of the main components a bit.\n\nBlueprint\nThe whole system is dependent on a ‘blueprint’ file, which is what gets stored at the tools::R_user_dir() location. It’s a list object with elements like the pet’s name, species (randomly generated), ‘date of birth’, accumulated XP, status values (happy, hungry, dirty) and some other things.\nThe blueprint is read and updated whenever you use a function from {tamRgo}. The current datetime is compared to the datetime of last interaction (stored in the blueprint) and the difference is used to calculate things like the pet’s age, XP accumulation and level and status values.\nThis gives the impression that the pet has been ‘alive’ on the player’s machine while they’ve been away. A trick6!\n\n\nExperience\nThe main goal is to accumulate XP and keep your pet alive. XP:\n\nis accumulated passively every hour\nis gained from the minigame in play(), where a higher score means more XP\nwill result in the pet levelling up when certain thresholds have been met, which alters their appearance\n\nAt a certain point, the pet will become ‘unalive’7. The chance of this happening is based on the pet’s accumulated XP. Basically:\n\nXP is ‘frozen’ at a certain age and the value is stored in the blueprint\nthe chance of becoming unalive is tied to the frozen XP value, where more XP means a lower chance\nthe number of days since the XP was frozen is used as a multiplier, so the chance of becoming unalive increases with time\n\nThe current XP count is stored in the blueprint, but is hidden from the user. This moves focus away from tracking and improving a single number and hopefully towards a more general goal of keeping your pet happy, well-fed and clean.\n\n\nSprites\nThere are character ‘sprites’ that change with age and species (see the image at the top of this post). The sprite for a newborn, mature and unalive pet are the same regardless of species, but the other levels are dependent on whether the pet is species X, Y or Z. Of course, these are pixellated to mimic the original Tamagotchi style.\nThe sprites are called by see_pet() as binary matrices of filled and unfilled ‘pixels’. I wrote the package {pixeltrix}, which I wrote about in my last blog post for a simple interactive way to design sprites by turning pixels ‘on’ and ‘off’ in a plotting window. Here’s a preview of a totally original little cyberfriend being incepted."

Should you actually do that? It depends. Can you use it in a silly R package for purposes of fun? Well, yes, if you ask me.\nYou can probably think of other ways to use tools::R_user_dir() for games in R, particularly for save states. Let me know when you’ve made a new triple-A game for R and I’ll add it to the list."

    "text": "{bs4cards}\nThe {bs4cards} package (available on CRAN) is great because it lets you create customisable ‘cards’ that you can tile on an R Markdown page.\nTo create a card, you use the card() function with arguments for title, image,1 text, link, etc. You can put these in a list and pass that to card_grid() to make a grid. Of cards. A card grid.\nSo, this format could work well to bring disparate information together in one central location, like a blog’s landing page, where a card’s content gives you a preview of post that you can click to visit it.\nSo I did just that: I made a single page2 where each card displays an art piece I created with R code for #RecreationThursday, or whatever.\nThe cards contain the creation date in the header; the ‘name’ of the piece as the card title, which links out to where the code is hosted for recreating it; and in the card body it states whether the image is a recreation, a remix or something original.\n\nYou can find the source on GitHub.\n\nGitHub Pages\nOne of the easiest ways to serve an R Markdown file on the internet is to store it in a GitHub repository, knit it to HTML and then enable GitHub Pages.\nYou go to the ‘Pages’ in your repository’s settings to enable it and then your HTML is served so that it’s available to anyone on the internet in the form &lt;username.github.io/repository-name/file.html&gt;.3\n\n\nDomain\nBut that doesn’t make for a terribly exciting URL. Since I’m going to be an internationally-famous and extremely financially-successful artist, it makes sense to improve my online brand with a rad URL.\nWhere to get inspiration? I’ve tweeted images for #RecreationThursday using the fax4 📠 and crayon 🖍️ emojis because I was using my rudimentary skills to create facsimile copies of original artworks. So… fax crayon? Like a wax crayon, but, like, fax?\nAnd the &lt;faxcrayon.art&gt; URL only cost two dollars to buy, so.\nThere’s a small dance you have to do to make GitHub Pages link to your domain, while your domain provider may themselves require a particular set of settings.\nIt took half an hour or so for the domain dance to complete, but now the site is available at faxcrayon.art."

    "text": "Smash!\nSuper Smash Bros (SSB) is a series of beat ’em up videogames featuring characters from various Nintendo franchises and beyond. The twist is that your health doesn’t deplete; instead you build damage so that subsequent hits knock you back further.\nThe series first featured on Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Bros, 1998).\nYou can fight characters directly but you can also make use of items and weapons from games across the Nintendo universe, such as the mushroom (the Super Mario series), the heart container (Zelda) and the home run bat (EarthBound).\nOne of the more interesting items in SSB is the pokéball. This item is used in the Pokémon series of games to capture and store Pokémon. When a player picks up and throws a pokéball in SSB, it opens to release 1 of a possible 13 Pokémon. The SSB wiki says that all of them are ‘common’, except for ‘uncommon’ Snorlax and ‘rare’ Mew (apparently only once every 151 releases, which is related to the number of Pokémon in the original game).\nSo how frequently in practice does each Pokémon emerge from a pokéball in SSB on N64?\nThis is a short post to sate my curiosity. I’ve used R code throughout. The post will update as I gather more data."

How could I create a ‘scaffold’ in {xaringan} into which I could place the page elements?\nFortunately, Emi Tanaka1 created Ninjutsu2: CSS classes for splitting your page into columns and rows. This is now built into {xaringan} along with her Kunoichi theme3.\nFor example, the split-1-2-1 class from Ninjutsu splits the slide into three columns that are 25%, 50% and 25% of the total page width (hence ‘1-2-1’).\n\n.split-1-2-1&gt;.column:first-of-type {\n  width: 25%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; \n}\n.split-1-2-1&gt;.column:nth-of-type(2) {\n  width: 50%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 25%;\n}\n.split-1-2-1&gt;.column:nth-of-type(3) {\n  width: 25%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0;\n}\n\nThere’s one line of CSS for each of the three columns that the slide will be split into. In this example, the first column (first-of-type) starts from the extreme left (left: 0;), the middle column (nth-of-type(2)) starts where the first one ends (left: 25%;) and the third one (nth-of-type(3)) starts from the extreme right (right: 0;)."

    "title": "Ninja scaffolding for {xaringan}",
    "section": "Adapting the layout",
    "text": "Adapting the layout\nSpecifically, I wanted to define title, body and footer-bar sections for:\n\na title page\na main, generic content page\na content page that could show a table and plot next to each other, with a wider table underneath\n\nThis means I could colour them and/or fill them with content according to some additional CSS formatting.\nTo do this, I tweaked Emi’s split-1-2-1 class to create classes with rows (rather than columns) split into the sections I wanted.\nBelow are some simplified examples of what I did. You can see the original CSS in the source code of the demo I’ve put on GitHub.\n\nDefining the classes\nThe title page has two rows, one is a large header area to hold a logo and the other is where the talk metadata goes (see demo):\n\n.split-title&gt;.row:first-of-type {\n  height: 35%; width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\n}\n.split-title&gt;.row:nth-of-type(2) {\n  height: 65%; width: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 35%;\n}\n\nThe main slide class has a title and footer section and the content goes in the large section between (see demo):\n\n.split-main1&gt;.row:first-of-type {\n  height: 15%; width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\n}\n.split-main1&gt;.row:nth-of-type(2) {\n  height: 80%; width: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0; bottom: 5%;\n}\n.split-main1&gt;.row:nth-of-type(3) {\n  height: 5%; width: 100%; position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0;\n}\n\nI modified slightly this class so the large blank area is split once more (see demo):\n\n.split-main2&gt;.row:first-of-type { \n  height: 15%; width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\n}\n.split-main2&gt;.row:nth-of-type(2) { \n  height: 40%; width: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 15%;\n}\n.split-main2&gt;.row:nth-of-type(3) { \n  height: 40%; width: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0; bottom: 5%;\n}\n.split-main2&gt;.row:nth-of-type(4) { \n  height: 5%; width: 100%; position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0;\n}\n\n\n\nUsing the classes\nHaving defined the CSS, how do we use it?\nLet’s say I’d saved this CSS into a file called custom.CSS, along with some font specifications in custom-fonts.CSS. Here’s a simplified YAML header showing how to declare these CSS files in your {xaringan} .Rmd file:\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    css: [default, ninjutsu, custom.css, custom-fonts.css]\n---\nThe CSS files are listed in this order so that the later-listed files take precedence if there’s any clashes. Remember also that in-built themes don’t need the .css file extension, but you need to provide the full path for any custom CSS.\nWith {xaringan} you name the class at the top of a slide to actually apply it, where slides are defined by three hyphens ---.\nYou can see an example in the source code of the demo I put on GitHub.\n\nClass split-main1\nSo, the split-main1 could be used like this:\n---\nclass: split-main1\n\n.row[.content[\nThis Is A Title\n]]\n\n.row[.content[\nThis is the main body area of the slide.\n]]\nRemember that the split-main1 class is split into three separate rows for the title, main body and footer sections. We can define what’s in each row with .row[] and then define the content inside a call to .content[].\nThe first .row[] call will take the style from .split-main1&gt;.row:first-of-type in our CSS, the second will take the CSS information from .split-main1&gt;.row:nth-of-type(2), and so on.\nNote that Ninjutsu also lets you adjust the content of classes by chaining calls like .content.vmiddle[], which will make the content vertically centred in this case.\n\n\nClass split-main2\nThe split-main2 class has an additional .row[] to define because the main body area is composed of two rows rather than one.\nHere I’ve added a split-two[] call inside the second .row[] call and declared .column[] twice within it. This results the main body area containing one row the width of the page and one row split into two columns (see demo).\n---\nclass: split-main2\n\n.row[.content[\nThis Is A Title\n]]\n\n.row[.content[\nThis is the second row of the page. It's full-width.\n]]\n\n.row[.content[\n.split-two[\n.column[.content[\nThis is the third row, which is split in two. This is the left column.\n]]\n.column[.content[\nThis is the right-hand column of the third row.\n]]\n]\n]]\n\n.row[\n]"

In particular, I used the split-main2 class to arrange a small table in the top-left, a plot in the top-right, and a full-width wide table below them.\nIt’s possible to create these kinds of layouts in other ways – like in {pagedown} or with fancier CSS skills. For now I’m most comfortable with {xaringan} and the features it offers, like presenter notes and presenter view. But this is probably less important if your goal is to output to PDF.\nI look forward to seeing how Ninjutsu and other {xaringan} themes develop to help with page layouts for reproducible presentations."

    "section": "Introducing {pico}",
    "text": "Introducing {pico}\nSo, you could point-and-click to create a folder with the structure and content outlined above, but I’ve also created the {pico} package to make the setup even easier.3\nThe basic process for using {pico} is:\n\nInstall {pico} with remotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/pico\")\nCreate your package with e.g. pico::create(\"mypkg\", \"~/Documents/\") (the second argument is a filepath for where to put the package folder)\nAdd new function definitions to the mypkg/R/functions.R script file\nInstall the package to your computer with remotes::install_local(\"~/Documents/mypkg\") and attach it like a normal package with library(mypkg)\n\nLater you can add more functions to R/functions.R (or add more script files to the R/ folder) and can reinstall the package with install_local(), using the force = TRUE argument to overwrite the old version.\nLet’s take a look at those steps in a bit more depth.\n\nInstall {pico}\nFirst, you can install {pico} from GitHub with help from the {remotes} package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/pico\")\n\nYou can look up the help files with ?pico::create() at any time.\nIt’s a really small package, but let me know if you find any bugs or you want to contribute.\n\n\nCreate your package\nThere’s only one function in {pico}: create(). It generates a folder with the minimum required content, as outlined above. You supply a package name and a directory (folder on your computer) where you want your package to be generated.\nAs a demonstration, here’s how to create a pico package called {mypkg} in a temporary folder. You should put yours somewhere more permanent and convenient like ~/Documents on macOS, for example.\n\ntmp &lt;- tempdir()\npico::create(name = \"mypkg\", dir = tmp)\n\nPico package {mypkg} written to:\n  /var/folders/cg/5x7y2f0x6tqb9mqrc13pd8_40000gn/T//RtmpRGhTOc/mypkg\n\n\nThis will output some lines in the R console that confirm your new package has been written to the location you specified (my example path here is convoluted because it’s just a temporary folder).\nThe name will be checked against R-package naming standards: it should contain alphanumeric characters or periods only, must have at least two characters, and can’t start with a number nor end with a period. The provided directory also will be checked for existence and, if it already contains a folder with the proposed name of your package, you’ll be asked interactively if you want to overwrite it.\n\n\nInstall your package\nSo, the package now exists on your computer inside a folder. Now how do you use its functions in an R session?\nNormally, you would use install.packages() to fetch a package from CRAN and install it to your computer’s R package library. We can do something similar, but instead of fetching from CRAN, we can fetch the package ‘locally’, i.e. from your computer.\nTo do this, we can use the {remotes} package, which we installed earlier. It contains an install_local() function to which you pass the package’s filepath on your computer.\n\nremotes::install_local(\n  path = file.path(tmp, \"mypkg\")  # change to your packages filepath\n)\n\n\n\n✓  checking for file  ‘private/var/folders/cg/5x7y2f0x6tqb9mqrc13pd8_40000gn/T//RtmpRGhTOc/mypkg ’ ...\n ─  preparing ‘mypkg’:\n ✓  checking DESCRIPTION meta-information\n ─  checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts\n ─  checking for empty or unneeded directories\n ─  creating default NAMESPACE file\n ─  building ‘mypkg_0.0.9000.tar.gz’\n \n * installing *source* package ‘mypkg’ ...\n ** using staged installation\n ** R\n ** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading\n ** help\n No man pages found in package  ‘mypkg’ \n *** installing help indices\n ** building package indices\n ** testing if installed package can be loaded from temporary location\n ** testing if installed package can be loaded from final location\n ** testing if installed package keeps a record of temporary installation path\n * DONE (mypkg)\n\n\nYou’ll see some output that describes the installation process, ending with DONE.\nThe package is now installed into your R package library and can be attached like any other package.\n\nlibrary(mypkg)\n\nNow the functions from the package are available for use. By default, create() added a dummy function called say_hi() to R/functions.R, which we can use now:\n\nsay_hi(\"chums\")\n\n[1] \"Ahoy-hoy chums!\"\n\n\nSo, we created an R package, installed it and used it."

The basic steps are:\n\nOpen the R/functions.R script\nPaste in your function definitions and save the file\nRerun remotes::install_local() with the argument force = TRUE\nRestart R, so the updated package is recognised\n\nHere’s what this might look like for our example package. First, you might add the function say_bye() by adding these lines to the functions.R file:\n\nsay_bye &lt;- function(name = \"folks\") {\n  paste0(\"Cheerio \", name, \"!\")\n}\n\nAfter you saved the updated file, you can re-run install_local() with the file path and force = TRUE, which will overwrite the old version in the package library.\n\nremotes::install_local(\n path = file.path(tmp, \"mypkg\"),\n force = TRUE\n)\n\nYou must restart R after you’ve done this.\nYour new functions will then be available from your package, much like the dummy say_hi() function was. Here’s say_bye():\n\nlibrary(mypkg)\nsay_bye(\"friends\")\n\n[1] \"Cheerio friends!\"\n\n\nSo, that means that all those functions you keep forgetting, or that are stored across multiple locations, can be made available to you from one package. And ultimately, all it required was install_github(), create() and install_local().\nNote that it can get unwieldy to add all your functions to the functions.R file provided by {pico}, but you can group them up into several R scripts in the R/ subfolder if you like."

    "text": "Huge limitations\nSo, I think {pico} is a quick way to get you from ‘no-package’ to ‘package’ quickly, but more importantly it has none of the esoteric, daunting structure and content of a ‘normal’ package.\nHowever.\nA pico package doesn’t encourage best practice, nor is it very useful for sharing. That’s why I think the only practical applications are for learning the basics of package structure, or for building a small package of functions that you might personally want to use again in future.\nI would absolutely advocate for learning how to make a ‘real’ package, because that additional structure and content is really powerful and exists for a reason. For example, we haven’t documented any of our functions. What if you add a function to your package but you can’t remember how to use it? We also haven’t tested anything. What if something breaks?\nI’ve written before about the wonders of {usethis}, a package made specifically to help develop your own R packages without thinking too hard. I believe it provides the perfect starting point for developing your own package without worrying about exactly what files are needed and where.\nThere’s a vast array of free web-based resources out there for package building. For example, some that I’ve found useful are:\n\nHilary Parker’s Writing an R Package from Scratch post\nTom Westlake’s update to Hilary’s post\nFabio Votta’s fun slides\nEmil Hvitfeldt’s {usethis} workflow\nKarl Broman’s R Package Primer site, a primer for package development\nHadley Wickham’s R Packages book\n\nYou should make use of those resources, for sure. Do not use {pico} for any serious work. {pico}’s purpose here is to think about how we might demystify package development. At worst I think it’s an interesting curiosity."

There’s a button to reveal the country it represents and another button to refresh the page via {shinyjs}. The back-end just samples a flag from the {emo} package and waits for you to hit refresh. The {bslib} package made it easy to generate a theme that keeps focus on the flag.\nSo now I’ve set my new tabs to open at https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/randoflag/ (tested on Firefox, Chrome and Safari on iOS 14) and I know what the Guadeloupe flag looks like now."

Plot\nThe click_pixel() function opens an interactive plot. If n_state = 3, for example, then each pixel will cycle through three states as you keep clicking it. You’re returned a matrix of these values when you hit Esc.\nThat was enough for {tamRgo}: I turned a binary matrix into a 1-bit sprite. But wouldn’t it be good—fundamental!—to be able to plot the matrix as an image with user-specified colours? So I made draw_pixels().\nI’ve added a three-state matrix, blue, into the package as an example dataset. Let’s plot it with simple colours:\n\ndraw_pixels(\n  m = pixeltrix::blue, \n  colours = c(\"white\", \"#879afb\", \"gray20\")\n)\n\n\nOf course, it’s the subtly-coloured player character from Pokémon Blue (1996) as seen on the Nintendo Game Boy Color.\n\n\n2. Animate\nNaturally, you could use click_pixels() and draw_pixels() to generate several images and combine them as ‘frames’ of an animation. Why not have a function that does this automatically?\nSo that’s what I did:\n\nframe_pixels() calls click_pixels() and adds the output as the first element of a list, then it passes that matrix into edit_pixels() as the template for the next frame (and so on until you choose to stop making frames)\ngif_pixels() takes the list of matrices created by frame_pixels() and draws, combines and writes them to a gif\n\nI’ve prepared pixeltrix::mario as an example of an output from frame_pixels(). It contains each of three frames that comprise Mario’s walk cycle from Super Mario Bros on the NES.\nHere’s what the console output looked like when I made mario:\n\nmario &lt;- frame_pixels(\n  n_rows   = 16,\n  n_cols   = 16,\n  n_states = 4  # background + 3 colours\n)\n\nClick squares in the plot window. Press &lt;Esc&gt; to end.\nAdd a frame? y/n: y\nClick squares in the plot window. Press &lt;Esc&gt; to end.\nCurrent frame count: 2\nAdd a frame? y/n: y\nClick squares in the plot window. Press &lt;Esc&gt; to end.\nCurrent frame count: 3\nAdd a frame? y/n: n\nFinal frame count: 3\nYou can see there’s interactivity; the user is prompted to add another frame with Add a frame? y/n:, where y will let you create a new frame and n will stop the process and return the list of matrices.\nAnd so you can see it’s a list of three matrices:\n\nstr(mario)\n\nList of 3\n $ : int [1:16, 1:16] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ...\n $ : int [1:16, 1:16] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ : int [1:16, 1:16] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n\n\nYou can then convert the list to a gif with gif_pixels(), which engifs the frames using {gifski}.1\n\ngif_pixels(\n  frames = mario,\n  colours = c(\n    \"white\",    # background\n    \"#FDA428\",  # skin (yellowish)\n    \"#FC0D1B\",  # overalls/hat (red)\n    \"#A32B2E\"   # hair, eyes, shirt, boots (brown)\n  ),\n  file = \"mario.gif\",\n  delay = 0.15  # passed via dots to gifski::save_gif()\n)\n\nInserting image 3 at 0.30s (100%)...\nEncoding to gif... done!\n[1] \"mario.gif\"\nAnd if we open that file:\n\nYahoooooo, created entirely with R. Noice.\n\n\nPix n mix\nSo {pixeltrix} finally got a couple of nice-to-have (well, must-have) functions. This is enough for me to continue just messing around with it as a novelty2.\nI mean, come on: animated pixelart created in an interactive R plot window? Why? I mean, er… wow!"

    "text": "Fontastic helper\nYou will hopefully have selected a font after countless hours perusing Google Fonts.\nRather than use Google Fonts to get the files, I recommend you use Google Web Fonts Helper). Why? It has a simple interface and gives you what you need in one screen (example: Open Sans).\nUse the search in the upper right and select your font. Sections 1 and 2 let you select character sets (cyrillic, latin, etc) and styles (regular, italic, etc). The default for many fonts is latin and regular, which is often what you want.\n\nNow we’re going to (1) get the font files and (2) make your site recognise them.\n\n1. Get fonts\n\nTo make the font files available to your site:\n\nGo to ‘4. Download files’ on the Helper font page\nClick the big blue button that says &lt;font-name&gt;.zip to download a zipped folder of the font files\nUnzip the file and copy all the files to the static/fonts/ folder of your site\n\nBy default, you’ll be copying across multiple file types (eot, svg, ttf, woff, woff2), which will give the best possible coverage for users of your site visitng from different browsers. You can, in theory, get away with using just the woff and woff2 files for modern browsers. Except there’s always an IE6 user somewhere.\n\n\n2. Recognise fonts\n\nIt’s not enough to just host the font files; we need to adjust some CSS. CSS files are basically style instructions that inform how HTML files (like our blog posts) should be rendered. You don’t need to be a CSS expert for this part.\nHere’s the steps in short:\n\nGo to ‘3. Copy CSS’ on the Helper font page\nCopy the CSS code\nPaste it into static/css/fonts/ (you can overwrite the CSS for any other fonts that you aren’t using)\nAdjust the font specifications for the body and title text, overwriting the font you’re replacing\n\nIt’s worth explaining those last couple of steps a bit more. The default static/css/fonts.css file for the Lithium theme looks like this:\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Merriweather';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  src: local('Merriweather'), local('Merriweather-Regular'),\n       url('../fonts/merriweather-v13-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'),\n       url('../fonts/merriweather-v13-latin-regular.woff') format('woff');\n}\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Lato';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  src: local('Lato Regular'), local('Lato-Regular'),\n       url('../fonts/lato-v11-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'),\n       url('../fonts/lato-v11-latin-regular.woff') format('woff');\n}\nbody {\n  font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;\n}\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, .nav, .article-duration, .archive-item-link, .footer {\n  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;\n}\n\nThe @font-face sections declare the fonts and where the files are stored. There are two: Merriweather and Lato.\nThe last two sections (that don’t start with @) point out which fonts should be used in the main body text and for a number of other elements of the site, like headers (h1, etc) and the .footer. Other elements can be added.\nYou can also name more than one font for each site element. For example, the font-family: 'Merriweather', serif; of the the body {} section says that body text should be ‘Merriweather’ but should default to the host computer’s generic serif file if there’s a problem displaying Merriweather.\nSo, you can copy-paste over the @font-face sections with the CSS you copied from the Helper and then adjust the font-family names with your selections."

This encodes 16 million colours total, which are easy for computers to store and interpret.\nEach pair of characters basically encodes red, green and blue. For example, the code #FF000 is ‘red’. It uses the highest of these hex values, ‘F’, in both of the ‘red’ positions, while the green and blue pairs are zero.\nThat’s easy enough to decipher, but what about #8ACD52 or #C0FFEE?1 You could copy these into a tool that returns colour information (many search engines can do this now) but they often return a sample and not the colour’s name.\nI’m red-green colourblind and have difficulty identifying and talking about colours, so that’s not always helpful."

I cannot do justice here to such a powerful thought technology.\nIn short, it’s possible to look at a hex code like #F2D359 and get the rough hue, saturation and lightness of the colour it encodes, which you can speak as an English phrase like ‘light washed yellow’. David, too, is colourblind and has found success with his method.\nThis post isn’t about colour theory and I’m definitely not an expert, but the point of the method is that you don’t need to be one."

    "text": "Introducing {dehex}\n\n\n\nThis is a hex logo, but it has a white background.\n\n\nRight, so I’ve made a small R package called {dehex} that you can use to:\n\nTrain yourself to read hex codes with the DeSandro Method\nReturn a rough English phrase for a given hex code\n\nAll from your R console.\nThe package is on GitHub and you can install with the help of {remotes}.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/dehex\")\n\nThe reason for the name should be obvious: you’re ‘dehexing’, i.e. converting from hex. But also I like the connotation of removing a ‘hex’ as in a spell. The colour is cursed; it’s trapped behind a code.\nUsual warnings: the package needs a refactor, there’s probably some bugs, but it works for me. Drop an issue or PR in the GitHub repo with any ideas or suggestions.\n\nCheat codes\nYou are thinking:\n\nUgh, this sounds like effort, just tell me what colour my hex code is\n\nSo I’m going to show you immediately how to retrieve an English phrase and a colour sample for a given hex code. Probably this is the most useful bit of the package for users who don’t want to become a hex mentat.3\nSince we’re ‘solving’ the hex code, the function is called dh_solve().4 It outputs a text string.\n\ndehex::dh_solve(\"#F2D359\")\n\n[1] \"light washed yellow\"\n\n\nIf you set swatch to TRUE, then you’ll get a plot filled with that colour as well.\n\ndehex::dh_solve(\"#F2D359\", swatch = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"light washed yellow\"\n\n\nHow lovely.\n\n Note\nI later noticed that the package {ColorNameR} exists, which has the express purpose of taking a colour code and returning a name for that colour.\n\n\n\nLearning is fun\nFor the more adventurous, you can use {dehex} to learn how to read a hex code with DeSandro’s method from your R console.\nThere’s five steps:\n\nSimplify from a six- to a three-digit hex code\nCreate a bar chart from the RGB values encoded by the short hex\nAssess hue (red, orange, violet, etc) from the chart’s ‘shape’\nAssess saturation (‘saturated’, ‘washed’, etc) from the range of the RGB values\nAssess lightness (‘dark’, ‘middle’, ‘light’) from the total of the RGB values\n\nI’ve incorporated each of these into {dehex}, plus a method for getting the answer.\n\n1. Three-digit code\nTurns out that the first value of each pair is the important one when determining colour, so you can shorten the standard six-digit hex code to just three digits.\nThat’s easy enough to do in your head, but the function dh_shorten() does it for you:\n\nhex_code &lt;- \"#F2D359\"\nshort_code &lt;- dehex::dh_shorten(hex_code)\nshort_code\n\n[1] \"#FD5\"\n\n\nAs it happens, the short code is still recognised by interpreters, but it’s often expanded double up each value to get back to six. So #FD5 is technically #FFDD55 rather than the original #F2D359, but that doesn’t really matter for our purposes.\n\n\n2. RGB graph\nThe values in the shortcode encode an ‘amount’ of red, green and blue. The lowest value is 0 and the highest is F, which is hexadecimal for 15. The higher the value, the more that’s ‘mixed’ into the final colour.\nYou can use dh_graph() to create this for you automatically. Rather than generate a plot though, we can just print a cute bar graph to the console. We’re only using it for reference, after all.\n\ndehex::dh_graph(\n  short_code,\n  adorn_h = FALSE, adorn_s = FALSE, adorn_l = FALSE\n)\n\n#FD5\nR ████████████████\nG ██████████████░░\nB ██████░░░░░░░░░░\n\n\nFor whatever reason, certain browsers struggle to render these graph outputs correctly in this blog post (seems fine in Firefox). In your console, the graphs will appear with neat ‘continuous’ bars instead of as individual blocks. Example in a dark theme editor:\n\nThe output is a horizontal chart showing the values of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) encoded by the hex short code. Each bar is made from 16 unicode block elements (i.e. 0 to 15), which are ‘filled’ to represent the amount of each colour.\nIf you’re using RStudio, this will print in colour, thanks to the {crayon} package (although you can turn it off with the argument crayon = FALSE). That looks like this using RStudio’s default light theme:\n\nOr, using a dark theme:\n\nPerhaps you’re wondering what the adorn_* arguments do in dh_graph(). They add extra information to the output that will help us in steps 3 to 5. I’ll switch these on as we go through those next steps.\n\n\n3. Hue\nFor our purposes, hue is basically a name we give a colour, like ‘orange’. We’re going to compare the ‘profile’ or ‘shape’ of our RGB graph to a number of others to determine which one most closely resembles ours.\nFor simplicity, we stick only to the primary, secondary and tertiary colours in the RGB colour system: red, green and blue; yellow, cyan, magenta; orange, chartreuse, aquamarine, azure, violet and rose. We also include a special case: grey.5\nThe {dehex} package has a built in guide that will print RGB graphs for each of these colours. Since this is a guide for hue, you pass the argument \"H\". I’ve hidden the output, since there are 13 graphs.\n\ndehex::dh_guide(\"H\")\n\n\n\nClick to expand the hue guides\n\n\n\nred\nR ████████████████ H 3\nG █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\nB █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\n\ngreen\nR █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\nG ████████████████ H 3\nB █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\n\nblue\nR █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\nG █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\nB ████████████████ H 3\n\nyellow\nR ████████████████ H 2.5\nG ████████████████ H 2.5\nB █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\n\ncyan\nR █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\nG ████████████████ H 2.5\nB ████████████████ H 2.5\n\nmagenta\nR ████████████████ H 2.5\nG █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\nB ████████████████ H 2.5\n\norange\nR ████████████████ H 3\nG █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\nB █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\n\nchartreuse\nR █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\nG ████████████████ H 3\nB █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\n\naquamarine\nR █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\nG ████████████████ H 3\nB █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\n\nazure\nR █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\nG █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\nB ████████████████ H 3\n\nviolet\nR █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\nG █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\nB ████████████████ H 3\n\nrose\nR ████████████████ H 3\nG █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\nB █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\n\ngrey\nR █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\nG █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\nB █████████░░░░░░░ H 2\n\n\n\nYou can see that I’ve added a value to the end of each bar, which represents the ranking of the RGB values. This follows the logic of the rank() function in base R: 1 is smallest, 3 is largest and ties are the average of the shared ranks. However, I’ve increased the tolerance for ties.6\nWhich of the graphs in the hue guide most closely resemble our colour?\nYou might be able to see by eye that it’s probably yellow, but we look at our graph again but this time with adorn_h set to TRUE (the default).\n\ndehex::dh_graph(\n  short_code,\n  adorn_h = TRUE, adorn_s = FALSE, adorn_l = FALSE\n)\n\n#FD5\nR ████████████████ H 2.5\nG ██████████████░░ H 2.5\nB ██████░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\n\n\nSo, we have an RGB hue ranking of 2.5-2.5-1, which indeed matches the ‘yellow’ ranks in the guide, even if the RGB values are not exactly the same.\nI admit this step is quite clunky and it doesn’t help that there’s so many plots to compare against. It’s easier I think when you have a colour wheel arrangement to look at, like in DeSandro’s talk. Remember: with {dehex}’s help, you just need to look at the ranking values at the end of each bar.\n\n\n4. Saturation\nNow we repeat the process for saturation. This time we’re going to compare the range of RGB values. This is easier because there’s only three (‘saturated’, ‘washed’ and ‘muted’) plus grey (i.e. zero range).\nThis time we pass \"S\" for the saturation guide:\n\ndehex::dh_guide(\"S\")\n\n\n\nClick to expand the saturation guides\n\n\n\nsaturated\nR ████████████████\nG █████████░░░░░░░\nB █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░\nS ████████████████\n\nwashed\nR █████████████░░░\nG █████████░░░░░░░\nB ████░░░░░░░░░░░░\nS ░░░██████████░░░\n\nmuted\nR ██████████░░░░░░\nG █████████░░░░░░░\nB ███████░░░░░░░░░\nS ░░░░░░████░░░░░░\n\ngrey\nR █████████░░░░░░░\nG █████████░░░░░░░\nB █████████░░░░░░░\nS ░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░\n\n\n\nThis time there’s an additional bar for saturation, labelled ‘S’, that indicates the range of RGB values covered by each level of saturation.

Lightness\nFinally, we do the same for the lightness of the colour (‘light’, ‘middle’ and ‘dark’. You can total up the values, where higher values are lighter, but I’ve chosen to mark the mean value in {dehex} because I think it’s easier to interpret from the graph format.\nProvide \"L\" for lightness to the dh_guide() function:\n\ndehex::dh_guide(\"L\")\n\n\n\nClick to expand the lightness guides\n\n\n\nlight\nR ████████████████\nG ███████████████░\nB ██████████████░░\nL ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░\n\nmiddle\nR ██████████░░░░░░\nG █████████░░░░░░░\nB ████████░░░░░░░░\nL ░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░\n\ndark\nR ████░░░░░░░░░░░░\nG ███░░░░░░░░░░░░░\nB ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░\nL ░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░\n\n\n\nAnd again, here’s the chart for our colour showing a column for lightness:\n\ndehex::dh_graph(\n  short_code,\n  adorn_h = FALSE, adorn_s = FALSE, adorn_l = TRUE\n)\n\n#FD5\nR ████████████████\nG ██████████████░░\nB ██████░░░░░░░░░░\nL ░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░░\n\n\nYep, slightly on the higher end, so it’s a lighter colour.\n\n\nSolution\nIf you followed these steps, you’ll have seen that #F2D359 is roughly ‘light washed yellow’.\nSo, {dehex} can therefore be used as a ‘training device’ to guide you through this process.\nThe idea is that you remember the hue shapes (relatively hard because there’s lots), the saturation ranges (i.e. wider range means more saturated) and lightness averages (i.e. higher is lighter) from the guides and compare your colour to those.\nYou can check your answer (or cheat, of course) by using dh_solve(). I showed this earlier in the post, but it also has the option to see all the matching charts for hue, saturation and lightness:\n\ndehex::dh_solve(hex_code, graphs = TRUE)\n\ninput code: #FD5\nR ████████████████ H 2.5\nG ██████████████░░ H 2.5\nB ██████░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\nS ░░░░░███████████\nL ░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░░\n\nhue: yellow\nR ████████████████ H 2.5\nG ████████████████ H 2.5\nB █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1\n\nsaturation: washed\nR █████████████░░░\nG █████████░░░░░░░\nB ████░░░░░░░░░░░░\nS ░░░██████████░░░\n\nlightness: light\nR ████████████████\nG ███████████████░\nB ██████████████░░\nL ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░\n\n\n[1] \"light washed yellow\"\n\n\nHere you can see the selected guides that best matched the input.\n\n\n\nTest yourself\nIf you’re really serious about this, you’ll want to practice with random hex codes, of course. Lucky for you I’ve included a function that will generate them.\nSee if you can work out what this colour is using the guides and method above and then check your answer in the details block below.\n\nset.seed(2021)\nrando_hex &lt;- dehex::dh_random()\nrando_hex\n\n[1] \"#76EA7C\"\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the solution\n\n\ndehex::dh_solve(rando_hex, swatch = TRUE, graphs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\ninput code: #7E7\nR ████████░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\nG ███████████████░ H 3\nB ████████░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\nS ░░░░░░░████████░\nL ░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░\n\nhue: green\nR █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\nG ████████████████ H 3\nB █░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ H 1.5\n\nsaturation: washed\nR █████████████░░░\nG █████████░░░░░░░\nB ████░░░░░░░░░░░░\nS ░░░██████████░░░\n\nlightness: middle\nR ██████████░░░░░░\nG █████████░░░░░░░\nB ████████░░░░░░░░\nL ░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░\n\n\n[1] \"middle washed green\"\n\n\n\nDid you get it right?"

We’ve all been there.\nMy mind immediately went to {officer} by David Gohel, which is part of the ‘officeverse’ for reading, creating and manipulating common Microsoft documents with R1.\nIn particular, the function officer::docx_summary() extracts all the elements of a Word doc into a tidy dataframe2. Each row of that dataframe is a heading, or a paragraph, or the contents of a table cell3.\nThis means tables are ‘unstacked’, with a row per ‘cell’ of the original Word table. How could you convert these tidy Word tables into dataframes for further use in R? There’s a suggestion in the docs, but I drew the rest of the heckin’ owl by creating a slightly overengineered function to do it4."

This code created a file with a heading, followed by two tables that each have a line of text above them.\nWe can read the document with read_docx() and extract the contents into a tidy dataframe:\n\n# Read the file from temp path\ndoc_path &lt;- list.files(tempdir(), pattern = \".docx$\", full.names = TRUE)\ndoc_in &lt;- read_docx(doc_path)\n\n# Get the content of the document as a dataframe\ndoc_tidy &lt;- docx_summary(doc_in)\nstr(doc_tidy)\n\n'data.frame':   43 obs. of  11 variables:\n $ doc_index   : int  1 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ content_type: chr  \"paragraph\" \"paragraph\" \"table cell\" \"table cell\" ...\n $ style_name  : chr  \"heading 1\" \"Normal\" NA NA ...\n $ text        : chr  \"This is a test\" \"Below is a table.\" \"mpg\" \"21.0\" ...\n $ level       : num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ num_id      : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ row_id      : int  NA NA 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 ...\n $ is_header   : logi  NA NA TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE ...\n $ cell_id     : num  NA NA 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ col_span    : num  NA NA 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ row_span    : int  NA NA 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nThe doc_in object has ‘rdocx’ class that carries the extracted elements and associated style information. Running docx_summary() converts this to the single tidy dataframe that we’re after.\nYou can see we have information here about the content of our doc. For purposes of this post, we care about:\n\ntext, which is the actual written content\ncontent_type, which can tell us if we’re looking at table cells\ndoc_index, which assigns an ID value so document elements stay together (e.g. cells of a table will all carry the same doc_index)\ncell_id and row_id, which tell us the x and y cell locations in tables\nis_header, which can tell us if the row contains a table header.\n\nNow to extract the table elements and ‘re-rectangularise’ back into a dataframe."

The headers for a Word table are marked by TRUE in the is_header column of the output from docx_summary(). Except when they aren’t. It’s possible that you’ll read a Word doc where the table headers aren’t identified. Set assume_headers to TRUE (the default) to allow rectangularise_table() to instead use the first row of the table as headers. The setting will apply to all tables; I reckon that it’s all or nothing whether table headers will be marked up in a given Word document.\nYou may also have seen the type_convert argument5. By default, the text column in the output from docx_summary() will be character class, but the actual data might be integers, for example. As explained in a recent blog post, the type.convert() function attempts to coerce a column to the appropriate data type if possible.\nAnd now we can see that the dataset works using our test document:\n\ndf_list &lt;- rectangularise_tables(doc_tidy)\nstr(df_list)\n\nList of 2\n $ doc_index_3:'data.frame':    3 obs. of  5 variables:\n  ..$ mpg : num [1:3] 21 21 22.8\n  ..$ cyl : int [1:3] 6 6 4\n  ..$ disp: int [1:3] 160 160 108\n  ..$ hp  : int [1:3] 110 110 93\n  ..$ drat: num [1:3] 3.9 3.9 3.85\n $ doc_index_5:'data.frame':    3 obs. of  5 variables:\n  ..$ Ozone  : int [1:3] 41 36 12\n  ..$ Solar.R: int [1:3] 190 118 149\n  ..$ Wind   : num [1:3] 7.4 8 12.6\n  ..$ Temp   : int [1:3] 67 72 74\n  ..$ Month  : int [1:3] 5 5 5\n\n\nSmashing. We have a list of two dataframes: one for each of the tables in the test document. I took the liberty of naming the list elements like doc_index_* so you can trace which doc_index they were in the original output from docx_summary()."

    "text": "Tide\nBasic premise: create a function that accepts a dataframe as input, opens the edit menu, observes the updated values and generates code to reproduce the new object from the old.\nI’ve created the concept package, {tide}, to do this.3 It has only one, eponymous function: tide().\nWhy ‘tide’? Well, it’s ‘edit’ backwards. And we’re ‘turning the tide’ on the edit() function to make it reproducible, geddit?4\nYou can install {tide} from GitHub. The {clipr} package, which can copy text to your clipboard, will also be installed.\n\nif (!require(remotes)) install.packages(\"remotes\")\ninstall_github(\"matt-dray/tide\")\n\nSo let’s get our feet wet with an example. Here’s a thematically-related data.frame of the tide table for London Bridge for May 1 2022.\n\ntide_table &lt;- data.frame(\n  type = c(\"High\", \"Low\", NA_character_, \"Low\"),\n  time_bst = c(\"02:58\", \"09:42\", \"15:20\", \"21:58\"),\n  height_m = c(7.0, 0.5, 6.9, 70)\n)\n\ntide_table\n\n  type time_bst height_m\n1 High    02:58      7.0\n2  Low    09:42      0.5\n3 &lt;NA&gt;    15:20      6.9\n4  Low    21:58     70.0\n\n\nBut whoops: the missing value should be ‘High’ and the height is wrong by two orders of magnitude for the 21:58 low tide.\nSo, let’s use tide::tide() on the dataframe to edit those values.\n\nlibrary(tide)\ntide(tide_table)\n\nThis opens a separate data-editor window. Here’s how it looks when it opens:5\n\nAnd once I’ve made the adjustments manually:\n\nAnd here’s what’s returned to the console once I’ve clicked the ‘Quit’ button:\nWrote code to clipboard\n##   type time_bst height_m\n## 1 High    02:58      7.0\n## 2  Low    09:42      0.5\n## 3 High    15:20      6.9\n## 4  Low    21:58      0.7\nYou can see the edits have been successfully returned. This is also what you’d see if you just used edit().\nThe extra feature from tide() is evident in the message Wrote code to clipboard: the function generated some lines of code that will take you from the original to the edited object.\nSo if we now paste from the clipboard we get:\n\ntide_table[3, 1] &lt;- \"High\"\ntide_table[4, 3] &lt;- 0.7\n\nIn other words, ‘replace the value in row 3, column 1 of the tide_table object with the string value \"High\"’, for example.\nAnd if we actually run those lines, we can recreate the amended data.frame from the original:\n\ntide_table\n\n  type time_bst height_m\n1 High    02:58      7.0\n2  Low    09:42      0.5\n3 High    15:20      6.9\n4  Low    21:58      0.7\n\n\nSo, hurrah, we now have a method of manually editing the table and getting some code back that can reproduce it."

So there’s not much point expanding this package beyond a concept.\nOr maybe the approach will pick up pace like the Severn Estuary tidal bore, who knows? Or maybe you think this post is a bore.6"

To install:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/linkrot\")\nlibrary(linkrot)\n\nIn short, the detect_rot() function takes the URL of a web page and returns a tibble with details of each link from that page and whether it can be reached.\nI’ve basically built it for my own amusement, so there’s no guarantees. Feel free to suggest or amend things in the GitHub repo.\n\nCheck one post\nLet’s feed in the first post on this blog, from April 2018:\n\ntrek_url &lt;- \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/\"\ntrek_rot &lt;- detect_rot(trek_url)\n\nChecking &lt;https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/&gt; ..............................\nIt can take a short while for the function to visit every link. To let us know it’s working, the URL is printed to the console and then a period (.) is printed for every link that’s been successfully visited (a bit like a progress bar).\nWe’re returned an object with a bunch of information.\n\nstr(trek_rot)\n\ntibble [30 × 6] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ page             : chr [1:30] \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/\" \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/\" \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/\" \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/\" ...\n $ link_url         : chr [1:30] \"https://www.r-project.org/about.html\" \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\" \"http://www.st-minutiae.com/resources/scripts/#thenextgeneration\" \"https://github.com/zeeshanu/learn-regex/blob/master/README.md\" ...\n $ link_text        : chr [1:30] \"R statistical software\" \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" \"Star Trek Minutiae\" \"regex\" ...\n $ response_code    : num [1:30] 200 200 200 200 200 200 200 404 200 200 ...\n $ response_category: chr [1:30] \"Success\" \"Success\" \"Success\" \"Success\" ...\n $ response_success : logi [1:30] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ...\nSo, it’s a tibble with six columns and a row for each link on that page that’s been checked. Basically, the output tells us the URL and text of each link and also whether the page was reachable or not.\nThe tibble includes a special officially-standardised three-digit ‘status code’ in the response_code column. These indicate whether contact was successful, with a specific reason. For example, 200 represents a typical success (‘OK’), but you may be familiar with 404 (‘not found’) if you’ve visited a broken link before.\nWe can extract any broken links using the logical response_success column.\n\ntrek_rot[!trek_rot$response_success, c(4, 5, 2)]\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\n  response_code response_category link_url                                      \n          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;                                         \n1           404 Client error      https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest…\nSo, at time of writing, that post has one broken link: an {rvest} package vignette for SelectorGadget that’s no longer active on the CRAN site. It has status code 404 (‘client error’), which basically means the thing couldn’t be found.\nWe can confirm this by visiting the URL, but you could also use the {webshot} package to go and retrieve an screenshot of the page3.\n\nlibrary(webshot)\ncran_404 &lt;- trek_rot$link_url[!trek_rot$response_success]\nwebshot(cran_404, vheight = 250)\n\n\nSo that’s CRAN’s 404 page to tell us that the page couldn’t be fetched.\n\n\nCheck whole blog\nNow we know how it works for one page, we can apply the function over every post of this blog and see how many links have rotted.\nFirst we need all the post URLs, which are all available from the blog’s homepage. The links returned are internal (like 2021/06/28/pixel-art/), so we need to add on the https://www.rostrum.blog/ bit. We also need to filter out any links that aren’t posts (like the ‘About’ page).\n\n# Load packages\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(xml2)\n  library(rvest)\n  library(dplyr)\n  library(purrr)\n})\n\n# The URL of this blog's homepage\nblog_url &lt;- \"https://www.rostrum.blog\"\n\n# Fetch all the links from the blog home page\nblog_hrefs &lt;- \n  read_html(blog_url) %&gt;%  # get full homepage HTML\n  html_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;%      # nodes with links, &lt;a&gt;\n  html_attr(\"href\")        # the URL attribute\n\n# Only links to posts\nposts &lt;- paste0(blog_url, blog_hrefs[grepl(\"^/20\", blog_hrefs)])\ntail(posts)  # preview\n\n[1] \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/06/05/tid-ye-text/\"                             \n[2] \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/05/25/cloud-pie/\"                               \n[3] \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/05/19/pokeballs-in-super-smash-bros/\"           \n[4] \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/05/12/accessibility-workshop-at-sprint18/\"      \n[5] \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/27/two-dogs-in-toilet-elderly-lady-involved/\"\n[6] \"https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/\"\nNow we can use {purrr} to iterate the detect_rot() function over the pages. By using map_df() we can get a data frame as output rather than a list. I’ve hidden the printed output from detect_rot() this time because there would be nearly 100 lines of output (one per post).\n\nresults &lt;- map_df(posts, detect_rot)\n\nSo, this results tibble has 23311 links from 95 posts, or about 25 links per post.\nAgain, we can filter the logical response_success column to see which links weren’t successfully resolved.\n\nrotten &lt;- filter(results, !response_success)\nnrow(rotten)\n\n[1] 61\nSo in total there were 61 links out of 2331 that did not return a ‘success’, which works out to about 3% being unreachable.\nWe can count the reasons for these failures by looking at the status codes.\n\ncount(rotten, response_code, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 2\n  response_code     n\n          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1           404    53\n2           400     4\n3           403     1\n4           406     1\n5           410     1\n6           502     1\nYou can see most of these status codes are in the 4xx range, which is the group of codes that mean ‘client error’. Usually this is a problem with the link you’ve provided, like 404 is ‘not found’, 403 is ‘forbidden’ and 406 is ‘not acceptable’.\nIt’s hard to tell whether this level of link rot is good or bad, but remember that these are links that have failed within the past three years. Imagine how bad this might look in another 10 years. By comparison, a quarter of links on the New York Times website were completely inaccessible, stretching back to 1996.\nI’d be interested to know whether this is comparable to your blog or website."

You’ll probably find the approach naive if you have any experience in dealing with HTTP requests from R.\n\nValidate, fetch, check\nYou can find the function definition for detect_rot() in the {linkrot} source code. It has three underlying steps, each of which has a helper function:\n\nCheck that the provided URL is valid with .validate_page()\nScrape the links from the page with .fetch_links()\nVisit each link and check its response code with .check_links()\n\nSo, the URL provided by the user is first checked with help from the {httr} package. We GET() the page and then extract the status_code() and check for an http_error(). If all is well (i.e. no error), then we can continue.\nTo get the links from the URL, we first scrape the page with xml2::read_html() and then use {rvest} functions: html_nodes() to grab all the nodes with links, then html_attr() and html_text() to extract the URLs and link text from each.\nFinally, each of the URLs is visited with GET() and the http_status() is extracted. The final data frame is converted to tibble (for ease of reading) and returned to the user.\n\n\nLimitations\nOf course, it’s possible that GET() will fail to reach a page for reasons other than it being missing. Sometimes there can be a momentary blip, but detect_rot() is simple and never retries a link.\nAdditionally, there are some links that {httr} struggles to contact. I wrapped functions internal to detect_rot() inside tryCatch() so any failures appear as NA in the response_code column. The printed output for detect_rot() also displays an exclamation point (!) instead of a period (.) when being run. For example, there were 8 links that had this problem for this blog.\nI welcome any thoughts or suggestions, particularly around testing. I’d like to use this package as a way to learn proper HTTP testing and have found rOpenSci’s HTTP Testing in R book useful so far. Eventually I might convert detect_rot() to use the {httr2} package when it’s released."

I’ve done a little R6-to-S7 translation on an old project to get a very cursory feel for it, featuring Animal Crossing New Horizons.\n\n Note\nThe S7 system and package are under development and could change at any time, rendering everything in this post useless.1 Heck, last time I checked, the system was called ‘R7’. There’s also a chance that S7 elements may have been integrated into base R itself by the time you read this."

And the pandemic was the perfect time to build an ersatz version of the ACNH in-game banking system to solve an exercise in the Advanced R book using the {R6} package for object-oriented programming (OOP) in R.\nThe exercise helped me fantasize about defeating the game’s main boss, the predatory loanshark (loanraccoon?) Tom Nook, via endless wire transfers of hard-earned in-game currency, called ‘Bells’.\nOf course, a lot has changed since 2020. Most importantly, a new OOP system for R is being developed. Conversely, Tom Nook has not changed. He is still a scourge.\nAnyway, maybe this is a chance to twitch my OOP muscles with this new system."

I’m noodling around with {S7} for my own devices and thought I’d post it here so I can refer back to it later.\nBasically I’m recycling content from a previous post to get a feel for the new system. But only in the most superficial, basic way. I spent about 15 minutes on this. Look elsewhere for actually-usefully material. You have been warned."

    "section": "That is class",
    "text": "That is class\nA new class is constructed with… new_class()\nWe can give it a name. We can also give it properties: fields that contain data and can be provided a type check and default value. It’s possible to build validators for these as well, which ensure that certain conditions are met when the properties are adjusted. I’ll keep this simple for now: I just want the values to remain equal or greater than zero.\n\nABD &lt;- new_class(\n  name = \"ABD\",\n  properties = list(\n    savings = new_property(class_integer, default = 0L),\n    loan = new_property(class_integer, default = 2498000L)\n  ),\n  validator = function(self) {\n    if (self@savings &lt; 0L) {\n      \"@savings must be zero or more\"\n    } else if (self@loan &lt; 0L) {\n      \"@loan must be zero or more\"\n    }\n  }\n)\n\nFor new methods, you can create a new ‘generic’ and define a function for it. For example, the ‘deposit’ method is pretty straightforward: it just adds an amount to the current savings value.\n\ndeposit &lt;- new_generic(\"deposit\", \"x\")\n\nmethod(deposit, ABD) &lt;- function(x, amount) {\n  x@savings &lt;- x@savings + amount\n  x\n}\n\nI specified some other methods, but I hid them because they’re not much more complicated.\n\n\nClick for more methods\n\nThe ‘withdraw’ method subtracts a specified amount from the savings property. You’re warned if you specify an amount greater than the amount available.\n\nwithdraw &lt;- new_generic(\"withdraw\", \"x\")\n\nmethod(withdraw, ABD) &lt;- function(x, amount) {\n  \n  if (x@savings - amount &lt; 0L) {\n    warning(\n      \"Withdrew all savings: \", x@savings, \" Bells.\\n\", \n      call. = FALSE\n    )\n    x@savings &lt;- 0L\n  } else {\n    x@savings &lt;- x@savings - amount\n  }\n  \n  x\n  \n}\n\nThe ‘pay’ method moves funds from savings to loan. You’re warned if the loan is already paid, if you specify a greater amount than there are savings, or if you pay a greater amount than the loan remaining. You’ll get a victory message if you pay off the whole loan.\n\npay &lt;- new_generic(\"pay\", \"x\")\n\nmethod(pay, ABD) &lt;- function(x, amount) {\n  \n  if (x@loan == 0L) {\n    stop(\"You already finished paying your loan!\\n\", call. = FALSE)\n  }\n  \n  if (x@savings - amount &lt; 0L) {\n    warning(\n      \"Paid total amount from savings instead: \", x@savings, \" Bells.\\n\",\n      call. = FALSE\n    )\n    x@loan &lt;- x@loan - x@savings\n    x@savings &lt;- 0L\n  } else if (x@loan - amount &lt; 0L) {\n    warning(\n      \"Paid total remaining loan instead: \", x@loan, \" Bells.\\n\",\n      call. = FALSE\n    )\n    x@savings &lt;- x@savings - x@loan \n    x@loan &lt;- 0L\n  } else {\n    x@savings &lt;- x@savings - amount\n    x@loan &lt;- x@loan - amount\n  }\n  \n  if (x@loan == 0L) {\n    cat(\n      emoji(\"smiley\"),\n      \"Sweet! I finally finished paying off my very last home loan!\",\n      emoji(\"tada\"), \"\\n\\n\"\n    )\n  }\n  \n  x\n  \n}\n\nThe check method is basically a print method. It reports the loan and savings amounts currently stored in the bank.\n\ncheck &lt;- new_generic(\"check\", \"x\")\n\nmethod(check, ABD) &lt;- function(x) {\n\n  loan_formatted &lt;- format(x@loan, big.mark = \",\", scientific = FALSE)\n\n  savings_formatted &lt;- format(x@savings, big.mark = \",\", scientific = FALSE)\n\n  cat(\"Automatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\\n\\n\")\n  cat(emoji(\"bell\"), \"Loan Balance:\", loan_formatted, \"Bells\\n\")\n  cat(emoji(\"pig2\"), \"Savings Balance:\", savings_formatted, \"Bells\\n\\n\")\n  cat(\n    \"Please make a selection from the menu below\\n\\n\",\n    emoji(\"house\"), \"pay()\\n\",\n    emoji(\"arrow_up\"), \"deposit()\\n\",\n    emoji(\"arrow_down\"), \"withdraw()\"\n  )\n\n}\n\n\nYou can start a new instance of the ABD class by, y’know, calling it.\n\nbank &lt;- ABD()\n\nWhen you check the class of this object, you’ll see both the custom class name and a reminder that it has the ‘S7’ class.\n\nclass(bank)\n\n[1] \"ABD\"       \"S7_object\"\n\n\nThe vanilla print method exposes the properties and their startup values:\n\nbank\n\n&lt;ABD&gt;\n @ savings: int 0\n @ loan   : int 2498000\n\n\nNote that the properties are prepended with @. This indicates that we can use the ‘at’ symbol to access these ‘slots’ (like S4) from the object, like:\n\nbank@loan\n\n[1] 2498000\n\n\nWhile we’re printing stuff, we can use the check() method (that I’ve pre-specified) to see the properties in a manner that more closely resembles the game.\n\ncheck(bank)\n\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,498,000 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 0 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 pay()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n\n\nYou can easily and directly change the properties. To add 10 Bells:\n\nbank@savings &lt;- 9.99\n\nError: &lt;ABD&gt;@savings must be &lt;integer&gt;, not &lt;double&gt;\nHaha, whoops. Remember I specified that the property can only be an integer, so we need to provide an integer value instead of a double value. In other words, we can only provide whole numbers of Bells. Remember that the L suffix is used in R to signify an integer.4\n\nbank@savings &lt;- 10L\n\nIs there an overdraft? Tom Nook would probably love that and would ask for massive overdraft fees, but it’s not programmed into the game. This is where our validator comes in handy. We specified that you can’t have a negative amount of savings, so this causes an error:\n\nbank@savings &lt;- -11L\n\nError: &lt;ABD&gt; object is invalid:\n- @savings must be zero or more\nThat’s fine, but I have sometimes I have extra logic I want to evaluate when I adjust the properties. That’s why I created new methods earlier on. It means I can use a function to add to the savings property instead, for example.\n\nbank &lt;- deposit(bank, 10L)\nbank@savings\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nWe can retrieve Bells in this fashion too:\n\nbank &lt;- withdraw(bank, 10L)\nbank@savings\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nWhat if we deposit enough Bells to pay the loan?\n\nbank &lt;- deposit(bank, 2500000L)\nbank &lt;- pay(bank, 2500000L)\n\nWarning: Paid total remaining loan instead: 2498000 Bells.\n\n\n😃 Sweet! I finally finished paying off my very last home loan! 🎉 \n\n\nThe method warns us when we try to pay off a value greater than the remaining loan and prints a nice congratulatory message if we’ve cleared the whole debt.\nAnd so we end up with this view:\n\ncheck(bank)\n\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 0 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 2,000 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 pay()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n\n\nHuzzah. Get rekt, raccoon dog. More like Tom Crook amirite."

Do you sometimes feel like you’re ticking boxes instead of actually developing your skills? Yeah, me too. Luckily, more active styles of learning are available. Maybe you can try working on a small, focused project where you can make mistakes and have fun. I’ve had success with this and, as a bonus, accidentally learnt more than I had planned to. I’ll give you an example of my experience and some ideas for how you might be able to do it yourself. The talk will involve a detour to an underground cave, but you won’t need any extra equipment.3\n\nYes, a cheeky teaser there to pique the interest.

Think about what you actually want to learn and develop a small-scope, discrete project around it. Make the subject matter fun. Fail meaningfully by be being open, recording what you’ve found, and involving your community.\nMy contrived soundbite is that module-based is done to you and project-based is done by you.\nIs this a new thought technology? No. Is it always true and applicable to everyone in every conceivable scenario and with every learning need? No. What’s my expertise? None, really. I’ve just spent a long time in lots of different departments and I can tell you what has worked for me4 as someone who entered the public sector with little computing or coding ability.\nAm I all too aware of how self-indulgent this all sounds? Yes. Did I need a whole talk to explain this? No, probably not. I’m happy if just one person stops to think about this next time they want to learn something. I’m also content if one person panicked slightly when they realised that R is a game engine now."

Click and drag to highlight points in the interactive plot ({d3scatter} package) and ‘brush’ the map markers (button in upper left) on the interactive map ({leaflet} package) and see how selections in each impact each other. Without {crosstalk}, selections in one of these widgets would not impact the others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find a more advanced example of {crosstalk} in action using Gapminder data. It links HTML widgets from three packages – {leaflet}, {d3scatter} and {DT} – and includes a couple of sliders for filtering. All of this in less than 80 lines of code.\nRemember all this is happening in the browser and without Shiny. And all you need to do is give each of your widgets a ‘shared data’ object. So instead of this:\n\ndata &lt;- readRDS(\"data/some_data.RDS\")  # get data\ndatatable(data)  # interactive table\nleaflet(data) %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% addMarkers()  # map\n\nWe can just add one extra line to create the shared data object and pass that to our widgets instead:\n\ndata &lt;- readRDS(\"data/some_data.RDS\")\nshared &lt;- SharedData$new(data)  # just add this line\ndatatable(shared)  # now refer to the shared data object\nleaflet(shared) %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% addMarkers()"

    "text": "Memestravaganza\nSince it’s 2018, the only way to publicise such a presentation is to exploit the power of memes and social media; the only method for communicating with millenials and younglings these days.\nBut why stop at one meme? Why not a meme advent calendar counting down the week in advance of the conference?2 You can find them all (plus bonuses) in my earl18-presentation GitHub repo\nI’ve reproduced them here with a bit more context.\n\nDay one\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, so I figured that Shiny was the only way to make interactive apps with R. But I had a problem: no server access for hosting the app. {crosstalk} is worth considering in this instance because you can share outputs as HTML files, which will open in the user’s browser.\n\n\nDay two\n\n\n\n\n\nR users can probably recognise an interactive app made with Shiny3. Probably a Flexdashboard is easy to recognise too; these are typically used for non-interactive dashboard displays, but {crosstalk} can be used to blur this line by making the elements interact with each other.\n\n\nDay three\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-explanatory, really. A small app can be made using {crosstalk} and shared freely. Try it!\n\n\nDay four\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s 2018. You’ve got to exploit Trump for personal gain at some point. One potential drawback of Shiny is the need to host the app on a server. Not ideal if you don’t have access to one. This is not a problem with {crosstalk}-enabled tools, which you can share as HTML files.\nBonus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay five\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, so there’s a false equivalency here. {crosstalk} doesn’t necessarily help provide a direct replacement for Shiny. You still need Shiny to make ‘proper’ apps. But hey, the picture that the little girl has drawn still looks like a cat, right?\n\n\n\n\n\nSince everything is rendered in-browser with {crosstalk}, you’re limited by your browser’s power. This means that the number of points on your interactive map, for example, is limited. In practice it’s maybe a couple of hundred. You can get around this by controlling point layers that can be switched on and off so fewer points are rendered at any one point But that’s a pain.\n\n\nDay six\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say you’ve read your data into the object data. Ordinarily you would do leaflet::leaflet(data), DT::datatable(data), etc, to create HTML widgets containing the data. To get the widgets to talk to each other with {crosstalk}, you make a shared data object: shared &lt;- SharedData$new(data). Now you can do leaflet::leaflet(shared), DT::datatable(shared), etc, to get widget interactivity. Only one extra line of code is needed.\n\n\nDay seven\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use both frameworks to do cool stuff! Just consider the context and the limitations of {crosstalk} when you do this.\nAlso, turns out I punked you: my talk was called ‘Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny’ but you can actually put Shiny in your {crosstalk}. Why? Your brushing and filtering with {crosstalk} can be used to generate Shiny outputs and vice versa. For simplicity, my talk focuses only on {crosstalk}"

Consider the base R function suppressPackageStartupMessages()1: it’s a whopping 30 characters, but all the words are important. Something shortened, like suppPkgStartMsg(), wouldn’t be so clear.\nIt made me wonder: what’s the longest function name in R?2\nBut! It seems tricky and time consuming to find the longest function name from all R packages.

    "text": "The long and the short of it\n\nBase R\nCertain R packages are built-in and attached by default on startup.\n\nbase_names &lt;- sessionInfo()$basePkgs\nbase_names\n\n[1] \"stats\"     \"graphics\"  \"grDevices\" \"utils\"     \"datasets\"  \"methods\"  \n[7] \"base\"     \n\n\nHow can we fetch all the functions from these packages? We can use ls() to list all their objects, supplying the package name in the format \"package:base\", for example. Note that I said ‘objects’, not ‘functions’, since it will also return names that refer to things like datasets.\nFor fun, we can use this as an excuse to demo ‘lambda’ syntax and the dog’s balls approach to function-writing, both introduced in R v4.1.3\n\nbase_pkgs &lt;- paste0(\"package:\", base_names)\n\nbase_fns &lt;- lapply(base_pkgs, ls) |&gt;\n  setNames(base_names) |&gt; \n  lapply(\\(object) as.data.frame(object)) |&gt; \n  (\\(x) do.call(rbind, x))()  # the balls ()()\n\nbase_fns$package &lt;- gsub(\"\\\\.\\\\d{,4}$\", \"\", row.names(base_fns))\nrow.names(base_fns) &lt;- NULL\nbase_fns$nchar &lt;- nchar(base_fns$object)\n\nbase_fns &lt;- base_fns[order(-base_fns$nchar), ]\n\nOf the 2465 objects across these packages, a quick histogram shows that the most frequent character length is under 10, with a tail stretching out to over 30.\n\nhist(\n  base_fns$nchar,\n  main = \"Character length of base-object names\",\n  xlab = \"Number of characters\",\n  las = 1\n)\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the top 10 by character length.\n\nbase_fns_top &lt;- base_fns[order(-base_fns$nchar), ]\nrownames(base_fns_top) &lt;- seq(length = nrow(base_fns_top))\nhead(base_fns_top, 10)\n\n                                  object package nchar\n1  aspell_write_personal_dictionary_file   utils    37\n2     getDLLRegisteredRoutines.character    base    34\n3       getDLLRegisteredRoutines.DLLInfo    base    32\n4        reconcilePropertiesAndPrototype methods    31\n5         suppressPackageStartupMessages    base    30\n6          as.data.frame.numeric_version    base    29\n7           as.character.numeric_version    base    28\n8            print.DLLRegisteredRoutines    base    27\n9             as.data.frame.model.matrix    base    26\n10            conditionMessage.condition    base    26\n\n\nSo there are four objects with names longer than suppressPackageStartupMessages(), though they are rarely used as far as I can tell. The longest is aspell_write_personal_dictionary_file(), which has 37(!) characters. It’s part of the spellcheck functions in {utils}.\nIt’s interesting to me that it follows some of those rules for function naming that I mentioned earlier. It has a verb, is descriptive and uses a prefix for easier autocomplete; ‘aspell’ refers to the GNU open-source Aspell spellchecker on which it’s based.\nI’m intrigued that the function uses snake_case rather than camelCase or dot.case, which seem more prevalent in base functions. You could argue then that the underscores have ‘inflated’ the length by four characters. Similarly, the prefix adds another six characters. So maybe the function could be simplified to writePersonalDictionaryFile(), which is merely 27 characters.\nWhat about shortest functions? There are many one-character functions in base R.\n\nsort(base_fns[base_fns$nchar == 1, ][[\"object\"]])\n\n [1] \"-\" \":\" \"!\" \"?\" \"(\" \"[\" \"{\" \"@\" \"*\" \"/\" \"&\" \"^\" \"+\" \"&lt;\" \"=\" \"&gt;\" \"|\" \"~\" \"$\"\n[20] \"c\" \"C\" \"D\" \"F\" \"I\" \"q\" \"t\" \"T\"\n\n\nSome of these will be familiar, like c() to concatenate and t() to transpose. You might wonder why operators and brackets are in here. Remember: everything in R is a function, so `[`(mtcars, \"hp\") is the same as mtcars[\"hp\"]. I have to admit that stats::C() and stats::D() were new to me.\n\n\nTidyverse\nHow about object names from the {tidyverse}?\nTo start, we need to attach the packages. Running library(tidyverse) only loads the core packages of the tidyverse, so we need another approach to attach them all.\nOne method is to get the a vector of the package names with the tidyverse_packages() function and pass it to p_load() from {pacman}, which prevents the need for a separate library() call for each one.4\nFirst, here’s the tidyverse packages.\n\n Note\nI updated this post in July 2023. The {lubridate} package is now installed as part of the tidyverse and many new functions have appeared across the multitude of packages in the metapackage.\n\n\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")  # if not installed\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(  # in action!\n  library(tidyverse)\n)\ntidy_names &lt;- tidyverse_packages()\ntidy_names\n\n [1] \"broom\"         \"conflicted\"    \"cli\"           \"dbplyr\"       \n [5] \"dplyr\"         \"dtplyr\"        \"forcats\"       \"ggplot2\"      \n [9] \"googledrive\"   \"googlesheets4\" \"haven\"         \"hms\"          \n[13] \"httr\"          \"jsonlite\"      \"lubridate\"     \"magrittr\"     \n[17] \"modelr\"        \"pillar\"        \"purrr\"         \"ragg\"         \n[21] \"readr\"         \"readxl\"        \"reprex\"        \"rlang\"        \n[25] \"rstudioapi\"    \"rvest\"         \"stringr\"       \"tibble\"       \n[29] \"tidyr\"         \"xml2\"          \"tidyverse\"    \n\n\nAnd now to load them all.\n\n# install.packages(\"pacman\")  # if not installed\nlibrary(pacman)\np_load(char = tidy_names)\n\nOnce again we can ls() over packages in the form \"package:dplyr\". Now the {tidyverse} is loaded, we might as well use it to run the same pipeline as we did for the base packages.\n\ntidy_pkgs &lt;- paste0(\"package:\", tidy_names)\n\ntidy_fns &lt;- map(tidy_pkgs, ls) |&gt;\n  set_names(tidy_names) |&gt; \n  enframe(name = \"package\", value = \"object\") |&gt;\n  unnest(object) |&gt; \n  mutate(nchar = nchar(object))\n\nSo we’re looking at even more packages this time, since the whole tidyverse contains 3071 of them.\nThe histogram is not too dissimilar to the one for base packages, though the tail is shorter, it’s arguably more normal-looking and the peak is perhaps slightly closer to 10. The latter could be because of more liberal use of snake_case.\n\nhist(\n  tidy_fns$nchar,\n  main = \"Character length of {tidyverse} object names\",\n  xlab = \"Number of characters\",\n  las = 1\n)\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the top 10 by character length.\n\nslice_max(tidy_fns, nchar, n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n   package       object                            nchar\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;                             &lt;int&gt;\n 1 rlang         ffi_standalone_check_number_1.0.7    33\n 2 googlesheets4 vec_ptype2.googlesheets4_formula     32\n 3 googlesheets4 vec_cast.googlesheets4_formula       30\n 4 cli           cli_progress_builtin_handlers        29\n 5 rstudioapi    getRStudioPackageDependencies        29\n 6 rstudioapi    registerCommandStreamCallback        29\n 7 rlang         ffi_standalone_is_bool_1.0.7         28\n 8 dbplyr        supports_star_without_alias          27\n 9 rstudioapi    launcherPlacementConstraint          27\n10 cli           ansi_has_hyperlink_support           26\n11 ggplot2       scale_linewidth_continuous           26\n\n\nWell there you are: ffi_standalone_check_number_1.0.7() from {rlang} wins the prize with 33 characters. What does it do? The full documentation is literally ‘Internal API for standalone-types-check’. Okey doke.\nIntriguingly, the next two are both from {googlesheets4}. The help pages say they’re ‘internal {vctrs} methods’. The names of these are long because of the construction: the first part tells us the method name, e.g. vec_ptype2, and the second part tells us that they apply to the googlesheets4_formula S3 class.\nSo maybe these don’t really count because they would be executed as as vec_ptype2() and vec_cast()? And they’re inflated because they contain the package name, {googlesheets4}, which is quite a long one (13 characters). That would leave cli::cli_progress_builtin_handlers() and rstudioapi::getRStudioPackageDependencies() as the next longest (29 characters). The latter uses camelCase—which is typical of the {rstudioapi} package—so isn’t bulked out by underscores.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, there’s only one function with one character: dplyr::n(). I think it makes sense to avoid single-character functions in non-base packages, because they aren’t terribly descriptive. n() can at least be understood to mean ‘number’.\nInstead, here’s all the two-letter functions from the {tidyverse}. Note that many of these are from {lubridate} and are shorthand expressions that make sense in context, like hm() for hour-minute. You can also see some of {rlang}’s operators creep in here, like bang-bang (!!) and the walrus (:=).5\n\ndplyr::filter(tidy_fns, nchar == 2)\n\n# A tibble: 16 × 3\n   package   object nchar\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n 1 cli       no         2\n 2 dplyr     do         2\n 3 dplyr     id         2\n 4 lubridate am         2\n 5 lubridate hm         2\n 6 lubridate ms         2\n 7 lubridate my         2\n 8 lubridate pm         2\n 9 lubridate tz         2\n10 lubridate ym         2\n11 lubridate yq         2\n12 magrittr  or         2\n13 rlang     :=         2\n14 rlang     !!         2\n15 rlang     ll         2\n16 rlang     UQ         2\n\n\nMany of these are due to {lubridate} using single letters to represent time periods, like hm is ‘hour minute’. You can also see some symbols from {rlang}, like the good ol’ :=, or ‘walrus’ operator.\nBoth the {dplyr} functions here are no longer intended for use. I’m sad especially for dplyr::do(): the help page says it ‘never really felt like it belong[ed] with the rest of dplyr’. Sad.\n\nIn memoriam: do()."

Some of them referenced the use of Git and GitHub (see Jason Baik’s scraped dataset) for version-control of their projects.\nIt wasn’t that long ago that I began working with the command line, Git and GitHub. Now seems a good time to record what I learnt and maybe someone else will find it useful, or suggest better approaches.\nI’m splitting this into two posts: one introducing the basics of the command line and one about a basic Git workflow.\nIn these posts I assume that you:\n\nhave little-to-no understanding of the command line and Git commands, but some experience of coding\nwant to version control your R project\nintend to store your version-controlled files in the cloud with GitHub\nwant to interact with Git via the command line, rather than with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\nare using a Mac and will access the command line via the Terminal application\n\nThese are relatively narrow constraints, but there will likely be some overlap with your particular configuration."

    "title": "Git going: the command line",
    "section": "The command line",
    "text": "The command line\nOur goal is to start writing Git commands at the command line. Before we get to Git, we need to know what the command line is and get some experience of working there.\nYou probably interact with your computer primarily via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) composed of windows and visual representations of files and folders, and probably use a mouse to do this.\nBut there’s another way: you can write text commands directly to your computer to manipulate files and folders. One benefit is that you can save and re-execute commands in a script, which is much more reproducible than an unknown series of mouse-based interactions.\nWhat language are we going to use to communicate? We’ll be writing in our computer’s default scripting language, called bash. In this post we’ll be looking at a few basic commands.\n\nTerminal\nOpen the Terminal application (tap command and space to search for it). Terminal acts as a Command Line Interface (CLI): a place where you can chat with your machine.\nTerminal is a simple application where you type commands and execute them. You’re presented with the prompt, which is the form &lt;computer name&gt;:&lt;current directory&gt; &lt;user&gt;$. For example:\n\nbros:~ luigi$\n\nThe prompt will appear each time your computer is awaiting an instruction. You just need to write your command after the $ and hit Enter.\n\n\nWhere are we?\nThe commands we input are going to affect the current folder we’re in, or other files and folders relative to it.\nWhere are you when you start Terminal? The prompt helps you orient yourself: see the &lt;current directory&gt; bit of &lt;computer name&gt;:&lt;current directory&gt; &lt;user&gt;$.\nWhen you start, the prompt will show the tilde ~ by default. This is a shortcut symbol for your ‘home’ directory, which on a Mac will be set to the path /Users/&lt;your-username&gt;.\nWe can prove this by typing pwd at the prompt and hitting the Enter key.\n\nbros:~ luigi$ pwd\n/Users/luigi\n\nThis command prints the path for the current working directory. The folder we’re working in at any given moment is called ‘the working directory’.\n\n\nLook around with ls\nWe can look at the contents of our current working directory with ls, which means ‘list the files’.\n\nbros:~ luigi$ ls\nApplications  Desktop               Documents\nDownloads     Movies                Music\nPictures      plumbing-invoice.txt  \n\nIt holds some folders and a text file. This command is analogous to double-clicking a folder to open it and look inside.\n\n\nFlags\nWe can go one better: we can add ‘flags’ to the command. These are arguments prefixed with a hyphen that change the command’s default behaviour. We’re going to ask for all the files and folders (some are hidden!) with -a and also we’ll use -p to append the folders with a forward slash to make them more obvious.\n\nbros:~ luigi$ ls -a -p\n./\n../\n.luigi-profile\n.gameboy-horror-token\n.poltergust-key\nApplications/\nDesktop/\nDocuments/\nDownloads/\nMovies/\nMusic/\nPictures/\nplumbing-invoice.txt\n\nSo now can see all the files, including the hidden ones. Hidden files are often settings or profiles for various programs, or tokens stored for API access. One example of a hidden file for R is an .Rprofile.\nYou can see a description of the command and the list of available flags using the man command. For example, try man ls to learn about the list command. Sometimes the contents of the man file don’t fit the screen; keep hitting return until the bottom, or tap q to quit.\n\n\nNavigation with cd\nKnowing what’s in our working directory is useful because it helps us navigate. We can switch to another folder with the change directory command cd. We don’t have to type the full path, just the path relative to where we are. So instead of /Users/luigi/Documents, we can just type Documents. In fact, you can start typing and hit the tab key for autocompletion, assuming there’s no conflicts.\n\nbros:~ luigi$ cd Documents\nbros:Documents luigi$ pwd\n/Users/luigi/Documents\n\nSee how the prompt changed to say ‘Documents’? This is a handy reference in case we forget where we are. To return to the parent folder (i.e. back where we were), we can use cd .. to go up the file structure by one level.\n\n\nCreate/edit a file with touch/nano\nLet’s create a file in our current working directory with the touch command and then convince ourselves it’s there by listing the folder contents. I’m choosing to write a Markdown file with the .md extension, but you could just as easily have specified a .txt text file, for example.\n\nbros:Documents luigi$ touch  mushroom-top3.md\nbros:Documents luigi$ ls -p\ncoin-balance/         mushroom-top3.md  monty-mole-fanfic.txt\nmoustache-wiggle.gif  plumbing/         star-locations/\n\nOkay great, but the file is empty. How do we write something in it? Well, you could use open characters.md at the prompt to open the file in your default text editor (TextEdit or something), but we can also write text from within Terminal itself. Perhaps the simplest way is to use the Nano editor, which you can think of as a text editor built into Terminal.\nYou just need to type nano &lt;file name&gt;.\n\nbros:important-notes luigi$ nano mushroom-top3.md\n\nThe prompt will disappear and you’ll see a header saying File: characters.md. You’re now editing this file with Nano. Start typing.\n\n\n\nThe Nano text editor running from the command line\n\n\nNotice the options at the bottom of the window. We can exit Nano with ^ and x (‘control’ and ‘x’ keys). You’ll be asked if you want to save; hit Y for yes. Then you’ll be asked for a File name to write: characters.md. You can edit the name or hit Enter to confirm. The content is now saved.\n\n\nCreate a folder with mkdir\nAs well as files, the command mkdir &lt;folder name&gt; will create a new folder in our current working directory. We can switch to the new folder with cd and can again convince ourselves by looking at the  bit of the prompt, or by executing pwd to print our working directory.\n\nbros:Documents luigi$ mkdir new-games-starring-luigi\nbros:Documents luigi$ cd \nbros:new-games-starring-luigi luigi$ pwd\n/Users/luigi/Documents/important-notes\nbros:new-games-starring-luigi luigi$ ls\nbros:new-games-starring-luigi luigi$\n\nNote that ls on an empty directory will return nothing.\n\n\nMove your files with mv\nLet’s say we have a rogue text file in our home directory (remember this is denoted with the tilde, ~) that should really be in a subfolder of Documents/. The command mv allows us to move it. It’s like dragging and dropping a file from one folder into another.\nYou can specify this in the form mv &lt;filepath&gt; &lt;filepath&gt; to move files to and from any path, or navigate with cd to the folder containing the file and use the form mv &lt;file&gt; &lt;filepath&gt;. The code below does the latter, using cd and ls to move between folders and show where the file is.\n\nbros:Documents luigi$ cd ~\nbros:~ luigi$ ls\nApplications  Desktop               Documents\nDownloads     Movies                Music\nPictures      plumbing-invoice.txt\nbros:~ luigi$ mv plumbing-invoice.txt ~/Documents/important-notes/plumbing\nbros:~ luigi$ ls\nApplications  Desktop               Documents\nDownloads     Movies                Music\nPictures\nbros:~ luigi$ cd /Documents/plumbing/important-notes/plumbing\nbros:plumbing luigi$ ls\noveralls.jpg  plumbing-invoice.txt  tighten-warp-pipes.txt\n\n\n\nDelete with rm\nWhile we’re in this folder, we might want to prune our files a bit. You can remove files with the rm command.\n\nbros:plumbing luigi$ ls\noveralls.jpg  plumbing-invoice.txt  tighten-warp-pipes.txt\nbros:plumbing luigi$ rm tighten-warp-pipes.txt\nbros:plumbing luigi$ ls\noveralls.jpg  plumbing-invoice.txt"

It is merely powered by the locator() function, which records the x and y location of a point clicked on a plot by the user.2\nHere’s a simplified version of what’s going on when you use locator(). If you make a plot and call the function, then the top of the plotting window in RStudio says ‘locator active’ and your cursor becomes crosshairs. Clicking on the plot returns a list of the x and y coordinates within the plotting space. The first argument is the number of clicks to collect before the locator is deactivated automatically.\n\nFor our bespoke locate_points() function, we can pass a character vector of place names. For this demo, that’ll be Kanto’s towns, cities and other places of interest. The function loops through the locations and requests you to click the corresponding point on the map. The console will read like Click on Pallet Town... and then found once you’ve clicked it.\n\nkanto_names &lt;- c(\n  \"Pallet Town\", \"Viridian City\", \"Viridian Forest\", \"Pewter City\", \n  \"Mt Moon\", \"Cerulean City\", \"Rock Tunnel\", \"Vermilion City\", \n  \"Lavender Town\", \"Celadon City\", \"Fuchsia City\", \"Saffron City\", \n  \"Seafoam Islands\", \"Cinnabar Island\", \"Victory Road\",\n  \"Indigo Plateau\"\n)\n\nkanto_pts &lt;- locate_points(kanto_names)  # initiates clicking prompts\n\nClick on Pallet Town...\nDuring the clickfest, the locate_points() function has assembled the points lists into a data.frame with one row per location.

Actually they kind of sound more like Pokémon names.\nAnyway, these ‘maps’ are the first steps to create something more exciting. For now they demonstrate the point (literally, lol). Plus they fulfil my belated submission for day one of the #30DayMapChallenge (‘points’)."

    "text": "Distances\nBut wait, there’s more.\nSo, obviously, why not work out the distances between towns? Not in arbitrary units, but in actual metres. There’s a few ways we could do this, but basically I’m going to peg a pixel to a known length.3\nFirst, we can create a lookup table of the straight-line ‘distances’ between locations, given our arbitrary 0 to 1 dimensions. We want to avoid being precise with these values (they’re only as good as my ability to click a tiny square on a computer screen), so I’m multiplying and rounding them.\n\nkanto_dist &lt;- raster::pointDistance(\n  kanto_pts[, c(\"x\", \"y\")],\n  lonlat = FALSE\n) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  round(2) * 100\n\nThe legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,\nwhich was just loaded, will retire in October 2023.\nPlease refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially\nhttps://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html.\nIt may be desirable to make the sf package available;\npackage maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.\nThe sp package is now running under evolution status 2\n     (status 2 uses the sf package in place of rgdal)\n\nnames(kanto_dist) &lt;- kanto_names\nrownames(kanto_dist) &lt;- kanto_names\n\nkanto_dist[1:3, 1:3]  # first few\n\n                Pallet Town Viridian City Viridian Forest\nPallet Town               0            19              45\nViridian City            19             0              26\nViridian Forest          45            26               0\n\n\nThese values are the number of arbitrary distance units between pairs of locations, which are given by the row and column headers. So, Pallet Town to Viridian City is 19 arbitrary units.\nBased on my own measurements, the centre of Pallet to the centre of Viridian is 64 in-game ‘blocks’, where a block is a 16- by 16-pixel square.4\nIt just so happens that the player-character sprite fills a single block5 and we know that the character is probably about 140 cm tall.6\nThat means Pallet to Viridian is about 64 * 140 cm = 8960 cm. So, one of our arbitrary units equals 8960 cm / 19 = 472 cm. Now we can correct our distance lookup.\n\nkanto_dist_m &lt;- round(kanto_dist * 472 / 100)\nkanto_dist_m[1:3, 1:3]  # first few\n\n                Pallet Town Viridian City Viridian Forest\nPallet Town               0            90             212\nViridian City            90             0             123\nViridian Forest         212           123               0\n\n\nOnce again I’ve removed some precision by calculating the result as a rounded distance in metres. Coward.\n\nSo this means we can now say some really profound things like it’s about 90 m from Pallet Town to Viridian City. Maybe that’s true in the context of the game’s dimensions, but it’s… underwhelming.\nWas this scuffed distance-conversion exercise worthwhile? No. \nBut it might strengthen my belated submission to day two of the #30DayMapChallenge (‘lines’)?"

I’ve used a period (.) and hyphen (-) to represent these in {remorse}, with forward slashes (/) between Morse groups that represent individual characters, and a space for the spaces between words.\nNote that not all characters can be converted to Morse Code. I did some research (Wikipedia) to discover the mappings from letters, numbers and punctuation to Morse Code. This information is used internally as a lookup, but is also exported in morse_lookup:\n\nremorse::morse_lookup\n\n       A        B        C        D        E        F        G        H \n    \".-\"   \"-...\"   \"-.-.\"    \"-..\"      \".\"   \"..-.\"    \"--.\"   \"....\" \n       I        J        K        L        M        N        O        P \n    \"..\"   \".---\"    \"-.-\"   \".-..\"     \"--\"     \"-.\"    \"---\"   \".--.\" \n       Q        R        S        T        U        V        W        X \n  \"--.-\"    \".-.\"    \"...\"      \"-\"    \"..-\"   \"...-\"    \".--\"   \"-..-\" \n       Y        Z        0        1        2        3        4        5 \n  \"-.--\"   \"--..\"  \"-----\"  \".----\"  \"..---\"  \"...--\"  \"....-\"  \".....\" \n       6        7        8        9        &        '        @        ) \n \"-....\"  \"--...\"  \"---..\"  \"----.\"  \".-...\" \".----.\" \".--.-.\" \"-.--.-\" \n       (        :        ,        =        !        .        -        * \n \"-.--.\" \"---...\" \"--..--\"  \"-...-\" \"-.-.--\" \".-.-.-\" \"-....-\"   \"-..-\" \n       +        \"        ?        /          \n \".-.-.\" \".-..-.\" \"..--..\"  \"-..-.\"      \" \" \n\n\nOf course, this means we can map backwards from Morse Code to letters, numbers and punctuation:\n\ntext_out &lt;- remorse::morse2txt(morse)\ntext_out\n\n[1] \"AHOY PAL!\"\n\n\nMorse Code has no sense of case, so it just converts it all to uppercase.

Hm, actually R recognises &lt;- as a ‘left-assignment operator’—a special ‘token’—that gives the name x the value of 1. Subtle, but important.\nAnother example: the tokens &lt;- and = have an equivalent role in x &lt;- 1 and x = 1. For style reasons, you’ll probably want to replace = with &lt;-.3 But don’t just ‘find and replace’ because = is context dependent. Consider:\n\nx = subset(mtcars, subset = carb == 8)\n\nHere, = is used to assign (=), to set a function argument (=) and as part of the equivalence operator (==).

Jeepers! That’s great, but now lets pick apart the frozen expression into its constituent tokens. This is where getParseData() comes in.\nThe function takes an expression object as the input and returns a dataframe with one token per row and several columns of handy information related to positioning and the relatedness between the tokens.\nFor now I’m going to simplify the output to show only the units of text that have been recognised as tokens, along with the name that R gives to each token under the hood (e.g. &lt;- is recognised as LEFT_ASSIGN).6\n\ncode_parsed &lt;- getParseData(parse(text = code_str, keep.source = TRUE))\ncode_parsed[code_parsed$text != \"\", c(\"text\", \"token\")]\n\n     text                token\n1       x               SYMBOL\n2       =            EQ_ASSIGN\n5  subset SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL\n6       (                  '('\n8  mtcars               SYMBOL\n9       ,                  ','\n14 subset           SYMBOL_SUB\n15      =               EQ_SUB\n16   carb               SYMBOL\n17     ==                   EQ\n19      8            NUM_CONST\n21      )                  ')'\n\n\nOh neato, so you can see = is indeed recognised as the token EQ_ASSIGN (‘equals assign’), = as EQ_SUB (equals in the context of supplying function arguments) and == as in EQ (the equivalence operator).\nIf you’re wondering, the keep.source = TRUE bit was needed to encourage parse() to return its output, which is a necessary step within this non-interactive blog post."

    "text": "Lateral parse\nI’ll leave you with another interesting thing that shows you the inner workings of R, which you might not realise as you run your code. We can look at how the code is actually executed, not just the tokens that it’s composed of.\nConsider how the {magrittr} pipe %&gt;% is used. Here I’ve slightly adjusted the input to filter for 6 and 8 carburetors; you’ll see why in a second.\n\nparse_out(\"mtcars %&gt;% subset(carb %in% c(6, 8))\")\n\n                  token   text\n1                SYMBOL mtcars\n2               SPECIAL    %&gt;%\n4  SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL subset\n5                   '('      (\n7                SYMBOL   carb\n8               SPECIAL   %in%\n10 SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL      c\n11                  '('      (\n13            NUM_CONST      6\n15                  ','      ,\n19            NUM_CONST      8\n21                  ')'      )\n26                  ')'      )\n\n\nOkay yeah, %&gt;% is recognised as a token called SPECIAL between the left-hand side of mtcars and the right-hand side of subset(carb %in% c(6, 8)). Notice also that %in% is also recognised as SPECIAL.\nIn fact, this is how R recognises ‘infix operators’ that are bound by percent symbols. This is some special syntactical magic that lets you put the function name between two arguments. So x %&gt;% head is equivalent to `%&gt;%`(mtcars, head). Perhaps SPECIAL instead of a more specific name because infix operators can be created on the fly?\nIf %&gt;% is SPECIAL, how do you think the base pipe is recognised in this simpler example?\n\nparse_out(\"mtcars |&gt; head()\")\n\n                 token   text\n1               SYMBOL mtcars\n2                 PIPE     |&gt;\n4 SYMBOL_FUNCTION_CALL   head\n5                  '('      (\n7                  ')'      )\n\n\nNot that surprising: it’s recognised as PIPE and not a SPECIAL, since it’s a proper base R token in its own right (as of R v4.1) .\nOkay, so we’ve seen how R parses these tokens, what about how it actually executes the code? One way to see this is to look at an ‘abstract syntax tree’ with the {lobstr} package.8 A ‘tree’ to show the nested structure of code and variables and so on.\n\nlibrary(lobstr)    # install from CRAN\nlibrary(magrittr)  # install from CRAN\nast(mtcars %&gt;% head())\n\n█─`%&gt;%` \n├─mtcars \n└─█─head \n\n\nYeah, like I said: x %&gt;% head() is ultimately executed by R like a normal function (block symbol in the output from ast() above), in the form `%&gt;%`(mtcars, head). You can see how the `%&gt;%` is a parent to mtcars and head() below it.\nSo the same happens for the base pipe, right?\n\nast(mtcars |&gt; head())\n\n█─head \n└─mtcars \n\n\nSurprise! mtcars |&gt; head is not executed like `|&gt;`(mtcars, head). It’s literally executed like head(mtcars). The base pipe is so special because it’s baked right into the R source code as a separate type of token that is recognised to have a job distinct from a basic SPECIAL. This should make it a little faster to run compared to %&gt;% as well."

Particularly the creators of the {rtoot} R package.\n{rtoot} lets you interact with the Mastodon API. It’s a sort-of analogue to the {rtweet} package for the Twitter API. {rtoot} was stood up very quickly by David Schoch (with co-author Chung-hong Chan and contributor Johannes Gruber) when it became clear that Mastodon was becoming the platform-du-jour for nerds.\n\nSet up Mastodon\nIt’s easier to set yourself up with API access for Mastodon compared to Twitter:\n\nSet up a Mastodon account on the dedicated bot server botsin.space (londonmapbot is @londonmapbot@botsin.space).2\nInstall the {rtoot} package.\nAuthorise yourself with Mastodon and get an API token.\n???\nAbsolutely do not profit whatsoever.\n\nSteps 2 and 3 look like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"rtoot\")  # on CRAN\n\nrtoot::auth_setup(\n  instance  = \"botsin.space\",  # the Mastodon server the account is on\n  type      = \"user\",          # i.e. for posting from R\n  name      = \"londonmapbot\",  # name the token file\n  clipboard = TRUE             # copy to clipboard\n)\n\nThis process interrupts you to interactively authorise the {rtoot} package in a browser window and copy a big long code to a dialogue box that appears in your R session.\n\nIt’ll then return:\nToken of type \"user\" for instance botsin.space is valid\nToken (in environment variable format) has been copied to clipboard.\n&lt;mastodon bearer token&gt; for instance: botsin.space of type: user \nI pasted this API token to a safe place and also stored it as a GitHub repo secret in the londonmapbot GitHub repo so it could be referred to while the GitHub Action was running.\n\n\nPost to Mastodon\nNow we can use the post_toot() function to… toot a post. Publish a toot? Entoot a noote. It requires a token argument that takes a special ‘bearer token’ with a particular structure that’s not too dissimilar from what the rtweet package expects of the object passed to its own token function.\nAside: token setup is made easy in {rtweet} thanks to the rtweet_bot() function, to which you can pass your API keys and secrets. It’s a little less obvious in {rtoot}, which was initially built with the intention of running API calls from your personal machine, so you could just store your keys in your .Renviron file or whatever.\nBut actually you can just mimic how {rtweet} accepts the token. To do this, I did not use my brain at all and simply ripped-off Matt Kerlogue’s post.3 My updated R script now contains this:4\n\nmastodon_token &lt;- structure(\n  list(  # it's just a list\n    bearer   = Sys.getenv(\"RTOOT_DEFAULT_TOKEN\"),\n    type     = \"user\",  # i.e. to post from R\n    instance = \"botsin.space\"  # the server\n  ),\n  class = \"rtoot_bearer\"  # special token class\n)\n\nWhere RTOOT_DEFAULT_TOKEN is that API token from earlier, which is required for accessing Mastodon. As mentioned, it’s stored as a GitHub repo secret and called into the GitHub Action environment thanks to the ${{ secrets.RTOOT_DEFAULT_TOKEN }} call in the YAML file.\nThis object can be passed quite happily to the post_toot() function.\n\nrtoot::post_toot(\n  status   = latlon_details,\n  media    = temp_file,\n  alt_text = alt_text,\n  token    = mastodon_token\n)\n\nWhere the status (body text), media (image file) and alt_text (alternative text for the image) objects have been generated already (see the R script for details).\nThis is then executed on schedule according to the cron string5 specified in the YAML file (currently twice a day at 0914 and 1714) to publish stuff like this:\n\n\n\nAwait Twitter implosion\nI want the bot to keep posting to Twitter for as long as I’m allowed to. In other words, we should try to post a tweet and catch any error silently, without disrupting the GitHub Action. So naturally I wrapped post_tweet() in a tryCatch() statement, yes? No, actually I used purrr::possibly() instead.\nWhy? Basically because the syntax is easy to remember, lol. And what difference does it make to have one extra dependency for this task? To use it, you wrap your function of interest in possibly() and then it can fail without erroring-out the whole function.\n\npossibly_post_tweet &lt;- purrr::possibly(rtweet::post_tweet)\n\npossibly_post_tweet(\n  status         = latlon_details,\n  media          = temp_file,\n  media_alt_text = alt_text,\n  token          = twitter_token\n)\n\n\n\nFiddle while Frisco burns\nWhile I was messing about with the londonmapbot code, I made a few things in the repo a bit more generic. For example, I altered the name of the GitHub Actions YAML file and the R script to be called ‘post-image’. This is more descriptive and it removes the need for someone forking the repo to have to manually change the name away from ‘londonmapbot’. You are so welcome."

    "text": "Kangaskhan you believe it?\nDid you know you can play games in R?\nI particularly like the text adventures The Secret of Landusia by Peter Prevos and Castle of R by Giora Simchoni\nThe latter uses object-oriented programming (OOP) for handling game elements, thanks to the {R6} package. So, a room in the castle is an R6-class object with specific fields (variables), like whether the door is open, and methods (functions) like openDoor() that can change the door state.\nThis is interesting because R is better known for being a function- rather than an object-oriented language. You can learn more about OOP in R from Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book and more about the R6-class from the {R6} website."

In the The Safari Zone you’re only allowed to take 500 steps, you can only use a special type of ball to capture wild Pokémon (of which you only have 30) and you can’t reduce a wild Pokémon’s health (hit points, HP).\nSo I went ahead and wrote an R6-class object to mimic the Safari Zone and bundled it in the {safar6} R package.3"

Loading the package provides a reminder of how to play.\n\n# Install first the the {remotes} package\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/safar6\")\n\nlibrary(safar6)\n\n# {safar6}\n# Start game: x &lt;- safari_zone$new()\n# Take a step: x$step()\nBasically, the package contains an R6-class object SafariZone, which you initialise like safari_zone$new(). Make sure to assign a name to it (x in these examples). This starts a routine with some text from the game and some interactive elements. Sometimes you’ll be prompted for a response; type a value and hit enter to make a choice.\nHere’s the opening sequence, which asks for your name and invites you to play:\n\nx &lt;- safari_zone$new()\n\nFirst, what is your name?\n------------------------\nNEW NAME (1)\nBLUE (2)\nGARY (3)\nJOHN (4)\n------------------------\nSelect 1, 2, 3 or 4:\n&gt; 1\nYour name: \n&gt; THEW\nWelcome to the SAFARI ZONE!\nFor just P500, you can catch all the\nPokemon you want in the park!\nWould you like to join the hunt?\n------------------------\nMONEY: P500\nYES (1) or NO (2)\n------------------------\nSelect 1 or 2: \n&gt; 1\nThat'll be P500 please!\n------------------------\nMONEY: P0\n------------------------\nWe only use a special POKe BALL here.\nTHEW received 30 SAFARI BALLs!\nWe'll call you on the PA when you run out of time or SAFARI BALLs!\nYou can then ‘move around’ by using the step() method on your SafariZone object. This method does most of the hard work in {safar6}, since it contains all the logic required for a wild Pokémon encounter.\nThe underlying values and calculations in step() are all true to the original game. That includes the encounter rate, which is less than 1, so you’ll likely have to step() a number of times before you find a Pokémon.\nFor convenience, the step method prints the number of steps remaining:\n\nx$step()\n\n499/500\nEach step is treated as though you’re walking through the tall grass, which is where you find wild Pokémon. There’s a weighted chance of encountering certain Pokémon at certain levels, but each wild Pokémon also has (hidden) randomised individual variation in its stats (HP, speed, etc) that impact your ability to catch it.\nHere’s an encounter:\n\nx$step()\n\n497/500\nWild VENONAT L22 appeared!\n------------------------\nBALLx30 (1)     BAIT (2)\nTHROW ROCK (3)  RUN (4)\n------------------------\nSelect 1, 2, 3 or 4: \nAt the prompt, you can throw a Safari ball straight away to attempt a catch, or you can run away from the encounter. You can also influence the Pokémon’s state: throw a rock to raise the catch chance (but you’ll also increase the flee chance) or throw bait to reduce the chance of fleeing (but that’ll also decrease the catch chance).\nWild VENONAT L22 appeared!\n------------------------\nBALLx30 (1)     BAIT (2)\nTHROW ROCK (3)  RUN (4)\n------------------------\nSelect 1, 2, 3 or 4: \n&gt; 3\nTHEW threw a ROCK.\nWild VENONAT is angry!\nThe Pokémon will be angry or eating for one to five turns.\nWhen you throw a ball, the success of a capture attempt is determined by several factors, like the Pokémon’s HP, its level and its catch rate (possibly modified by rocks and bait). It may also run away given factors like its speed.\nTHEW threw a ROCK.\nWild VENONAT is angry!\n------------------------\nBALLx30 (1)     BAIT (2)\nTHROW ROCK (3)  RUN (4)\n------------------------\nSelect 1, 2, 3 or 4: \n&gt; 1\nTHEW used SAFARI BALL!\nWobble...\nDarn! The POKeMON broke free!\nYou may want to change your strategy. More rocks, or some bait? While it’s still angry, you could take advantage of its heightened catch rate by throwing another ball.\nWild VENONAT is angry!\n------------------------\nBALLx29 (1)     BAIT (2)\nTHROW ROCK (3)  RUN (4)\n------------------------\nSelect 1, 2, 3 or 4: \n&gt; 1\nTHEW used SAFARI BALL!\nWobble...

The Pokémon were flighty and it was especially hard to trap rare encounters like Chansey, Pinsir and Scyther.\nThe most captures I’ve made on a playthrough of {safar6} is three (!), so use that as a yardstick."

    "text": "Exeggcute-ing the class\nI tried to keep things simple, so there’s a number of omissions compared to the original game. For example, there’s no visuals or sounds; I’ve simulated only the ‘Center’ hub area of the Safari Zone; you walk around as though you’re always in tall grass; you can’t fish or use different rod types; you’re restricted to the catch rates and Pokémon identities of the Blue game (not Red or Yellow, which are different).\nOn the flipside, I tried to maintain some subtle true-to-the-original elements. For example, you’ll be prompted to enter your name; you can nickname your Pokémon; there’s ‘wobble logic’ for deciding how many times the ball should shake before a capture; and the majority of the text is as it appears in the game. I’ve also made it so the text is progressively revealed, character by character.\n\n\n\nProgressive text reveal. Takes longer to print but is more authentic.\n\n\nIn particular, I’ve tried to keep the various hidden and non-hidden Pokémon stats and calculations true to Pokémon Blue. For example, I built in:\n\noriginal encounter rates, both for the Safari Zone and the wild Pokémon in it\nwild Pokémon base statistics and calculation of randomised individual values\ncatch rates based on factors like ball type and HP, and any modifications during the encounter\ntracking of ‘eating’ and ‘anger’ statuses and the effects on catch rates\nthe calculation for whether a wild Pokémon will flee\n\nThere’s no guarantee I’ve got these things completely right, but the gameplay appears similar to the original, so I think it’s close enough."

    "text": "Potato…\nI could just leave it there, but I think the interesting thing for R users are the various little methods required to make the ‘game’ function.\nTo display text to the user in the console, we can use cat() or message(). I kinda prefer message() because the user has more control over it in general, like suppressMessages() (which does what you think it does).\n\nmessage(\"Hello world!\")\n\nHello world!\nThere’s a subtlety in presentation too, which is that the two functions return text in different colours.\nThe game loop itself runs inside a repeat, which is maybe uncommon for some R users. We’re mostly used to for or while loops for iteration with a known set of things to iterate over, whereas repeat will keep going until we specify a break.\n\nrepeat {\n  \n  if (keep_going) {\n    do_something()\n  }\n  \n  if (!keep_going) {\n    break\n  }\n  \n}\n\nYou can imagine a scenario where keep_going is set to TRUE and some actions happen as a result; and that if it becomes FALSE then the game loop ends. In {potato}, we make sure to first print the current values of DESTINY, POTATO and ORC so the user sees them before the game continues or ends.\nWhat are DESTINY, POTATO and ORC? Before we initiate that repeat loop we can specify a bunch of starting values for some important scoring variables. Stylistically, it makes sense to use ALL CAPS for these (that’s how they were written in the original game, after all), but there’s also an old-school rule-of-thumb to specify variables this way in R code so you can more easily spot them in your code.\n\nDESTINY &lt;- 0L\nPOTATO  &lt;- 0L\nORC     &lt;- 0L\n\nin addition, we clearly need user input to decide what to do during the game. Most of the time, a user’s hand is forced and they need to roll. But sometimes they have the choice to remove an orc at the cost of one or more potatoes (depending on how the die falls).\nThis is a logical variable that we can keep track of, i.e. can the user pay (TRUE or FALSE)?\n\ncan_pay &lt;- FALSE\n\nif (COST &lt;= POTATO) {\n  can_pay &lt;- TRUE\n} else if (COST &gt; POTATO) {\n  can_pay &lt;- FALSE\n}\n\nIf the cost to yeet an orc is equal-to or less-than the number of potatoes, we can elect to make the payment. This is expressed in the options provided to the user on the command line.\nGiven the can_pay value, the user will get the option to either roll the die (FALSE):\n\nevent &lt;- readline(\n  \"Press [ENTER] to roll... \"\n)\n\nOr choose to roll the die or make the payment (TRUE):\n\nevent &lt;- readline(\n  \"Press [ENTER] to roll or [p] to pay 1 POTATO to remove 1 ORC... \"\n)\n\nBoth of which require user input that results in a value stored in the event object. Note that hitting Enter results in an empty string (\"\").\nDie-roll values pass through a series of if statements that are activated based on the number rolled. So if you roll 1 or 2, you’re In the garden...; if 3 or 4, you’ll get A knock on the door...; else the potato cost per orc-yeet increases by 1).\nA second roll is made automatically when in the garden or when a knock is heard. Here’s what happens if a 1 is rolled when in the garden:\n\nif (rolled_garden == 1L) {\n  \n  message(\n    paste(\n      rolled_garden_msg,\n      \"You happily root about all day in your garden.\"\n    )\n  )\n  \n  message(\"- Result: +1 POTATO\")\n  \n  POTATO &lt;- POTATO + 1L\n  \n}\n\nExcellent, the POTATO variable counter is increased by 1 in this case and confirmed to the user in a message(). The latest DESTINY, POTATO and ORC scores are then printed back to the user at the start of the next repeat loop.\nAnd then you just… keep potatoing."

The information can then be extracted and presented on the front-end. The ‘Update Metadata’ option from the {blogdown} RStudio addin is useful for making changes to the YAML.\nHere’s the YAML for the post you’re reading currently:\n---\ntitle: '{blogdown}: add metadata to Lithium-themed posts'\nauthor: Matt Dray\ndate: 2019-09-06\ncategories:\n  - blog-meta\n  - code\nslug: lithium-metadata\ntags:\n  - blogdown\n  - hugo\n  - lithium\n  - r\n  - yihui\n---\nYou need to make sure the author, categories and tags elements are completed before they can be extracted and displayed on your posts.\nYou need to update the files that specify the layout of your site, but where are they? And how do you translate these YAML elements into parameters that are understood in those files?\n\nWhat’s missing where?\nThe basics of what you need to do is all laid out in the excellent blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown book by Yihui, Amber Thomas, Alison Hill.\nThe file describing the layout of your posts—the one you need to edit—is on this path: layouts/_default/single.html (see the default template).\nIt’s an HTML file, so has lots of things like &lt;h1 class=\"article-title\"&gt;. This is pretty classic HTML that declares a top-level header and a class that can be styled with CSS.\nBut what we really care about are the things that look like {{ .Title }}. The parameter names embraced in double-curly brackets refer to our YAML elements, but they don’t necessarily have the same name (title in YAML and .Title here, for example).\nSo &lt;h1 class=\"article-title\"&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt; will return the title of the post as an HTML header that will be styled as the article-title class.\n\n\nModifications\nI hadn’t added the author name in the past because I wasn’t sure what the right parameter was. I found it in section 2.5.1 of the blogdown book: .Params.author.\nThis meant I could arrange some metadata at the top of my posts in the form Firstname Lastname / DD Mon YYY / X min read with the line {{ .Params.author }} / {{ .Date.Format \"02 Jan 2006\" }} / {{ .ReadingTime }} min read to get what I wanted.\nDisplaying categories and tags is trickier. It’s not just about finding the right parameters, but also involves looping through the categories and tags specified in each post’s YAML. Fortunately, the code is provided in section 2.5.2 of the blogdown book, under the bullet ‘Display categories and tags in a post if provided in its YAML’. It looks like this:\n&lt;p class=\"terms\"&gt;\n  {{ range $i := (slice \"categories\" \"tags\") }}\n  {{ with ($.Param $i) }}\n  {{ $i | title }}:\n  {{ range $k := . }}\n  &lt;a href='{{ relURL (print \"/\" $i \"/\" $k | urlize) }}'&gt;{{$k}}&lt;/a&gt;\n  {{ end }}\n  {{ end }}\n  {{ end }}\n&lt;/p&gt;\nI slid this into my single.html file with some trial and error, using a &lt;br&gt; linebreak tag to split the categories and tags onto two separate lines."

RAP’s purpose is to overcome a legacy of fragmented point-and-click processes into code-driven end-to-end pipelines that improve speed, accuracy and reproducibility; including workflows that generate statistical spreadsheets for publication.\nIt will take time for these approaches to become 100% embedded across government, due to factors like the inevitable inertia that comes with trying to leave legacy processes behind.1\nHow can we grease the wheels?"

For now it does what I want it to do and it works on my machine.\nYou can download it from GitHub with help from the {remotes} package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/gpx3d\")\n\nThere are a number of dependencies, including many that are not available on CRAN; see the README for {ggrgl} for details. You must also install XQuartz, if you haven’t already.\nThe package does two things and has two exported functions:\n\nextract_gpx3d() gets the data out of a GPX file (i.e. it reads a GPX file; parses the XML; extracts datetime, latitude, longitude and elevation; converts to sf-class; and calculates the distance covered)\nplot_gpx3d() plots the data as an interactive 3D object (i.e. it takes the output from extract_gpx3d(), generates a ‘3D ggplot’ using {ggrgl} and renders it as an interactive object to an external device)\n\nThere are also two demo datasets:\n\nsegment.gpx, a GPX file containing a shorter, edited version of the route used in this blogpost, which you can access with system.file(\"extdata\", \"segment.gpx\", package = \"gpx3d\") after installing the package\ngpx_segment, an sf-class data.frame that’s the result of using the extract_gpx3d() on the built-in segment.gpx file\n\nRead on for an explanation and examples.\n\nExtract\nThere are already functions that can help read GPX files into R, like gpx::read_gpx() and plotKML::readGPX(), but I decided to do it by hand with {xml2} to get a custom output format (and to practice handling XML).\nIn short, the extract_gpx3d() function uses read_xml() to read the GPX file, then as_list() to convert it to a deeply nested list. A little wrangling is then required to create a data.frame: datetime and elevation can be hoisted out of the list okay, but the longitude and latitude are actually extracted from the attributes.\nAfter this, the data.frame is converted to the ‘geography-aware’ sf-class.2 I’ve done this for two reasons: (1) the output object can be taken away and will play nicely with various {sf} functions, letting you create various maps and perform further processing, and (2) it allowed me to calculate the distance between each recorded point, which could be summed for total distance.\nTo use extract_gpx3d(), simply pass a path to a GPX file. I’ve chosen a 10 km run I took on Christmas morning,3 which I downloaded from Apple Health and stored locally.4\n\nfile &lt;- \"~/Documents/data/apple_health_export/workout-routes/route_2021-12-25_10.31am.gpx\"\nroute &lt;- gpx3d::extract_gpx3d(file)\nroute[2000:2004, ]\n\nSimple feature collection with 5 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 0.559015 ymin: 50.85109 xmax: 0.559273 ymax: 50.85109\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n                    time      ele      lon      lat                  geometry\n2000 2021-12-25 09:13:29 8.406136 0.559273 50.85109 POINT (0.559273 50.85109)\n2001 2021-12-25 09:13:30 8.498508 0.559209 50.85109 POINT (0.559209 50.85109)\n2002 2021-12-25 09:13:31 8.599027 0.559144 50.85109 POINT (0.559144 50.85109)\n2003 2021-12-25 09:13:32 8.721706 0.559079 50.85109 POINT (0.559079 50.85109)\n2004 2021-12-25 09:13:34 8.858613 0.559015 50.85109 POINT (0.559015 50.85109)\n         distance\n2000 4.564465 [m]\n2001 4.494285 [m]\n2002 4.564465 [m]\n2003 4.564465 [m]\n2004 4.492909 [m]\n\n\nYou can see the rows are basically a measurement per second (time) of the coordinates (lon and lat) and elevation (ele), and that the sf-class metadata and geometry column are present, along with the distance in metres from the previous to current point.\nYou can take this dataset away and do other stuff with it, like create a lat-long plot of the route (below left), or the elevation over time (below right).\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = rep(0, 4))\nwith(route, plot(lon, lat, type = \"l\", axes = FALSE))\nwith(route, plot(time, ele, type = \"l\", axes = FALSE))\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re wondering about the little ‘tail’ in the bottom right of the route, I accidentally joined the back of a Parkrun, so quickly did a hairpin turn to escape. Except the Parkrun route is a ‘there-and-back’ course, so the confused stewards thought I was now in the lead with a pace of about two minutes per kilometre. Whoops!\nThe elevation plot is pretty dramatic: roughly, it goes downhill to a small plateau, down again to a flatter plateau, then the inevitable (steep!) climb. The lowest plateau is along the seafront, so basically sea level.\nBut boo! Only two dimensions? You can instead use the plotting function built in to {gpx3d} for something a bit more exciting.\n\n\nPlot\nAll the hard work of plotting is done primarily by {ggplot2} and {ggrgl}. The former is probably well-known to readers; the latter is an extension written by mikefc to introduce a third dimension to ggplot objects. In other words, you can extrude your plot along some third variable to generate a z-axis.\nThere’s a whole bunch of specialised 3D geoms in {ggrgl}. For my purposes, I wanted to extend a geom_path() line plot into the third dimension. This is achieved by adding a z argument to the aes() call of the geom_path_3d() function, where z is our elevation data.\nAnd so the plot_gpx3d() function in {gpx3d} renders the plot as an interactive 3D object with {rgl} to an external devoutrgl::rgldev() graphics device.5 You can then click and drag it with your mouse and use the scrollwheel to zoom. I’ve embedded a gif of the output at the top of this thread.6\n\ngpx3d::plot_gpx3d(route)\n\nYou can see why I chose this particular route for the demo; it really shows off the power of the elevation data. I ran anti-clockwise downhill to the seafront, where it was almost entirely flat, before running back up a relatively sharp ascent.\nMight have made a nice print if I’d been gifted a 3D printer for Christmas!\n\n Note\nI was originally able to embed the interactive 3D graphic in this post, but it failed to work when I ported this blog over to Quarto in 2023. Maybe I’ll try to fix it one day."

This was made possible by using the {R6} package by Winston Chang, which provides an implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) in R.\nAn R6 class has ‘fields’ (variables) and ‘methods’ (functions) that can adjust the field values. This means you can manipulate the state of the object over time. You can read more in the {R6} documentation or in Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book.\nSo you could create a class with a field that provides the location of a character, then let the user apply a method to overwrite that location. If you print the ‘before’ and ‘after’ states, you’ll get the impression of movement for the character."

It’s pretty simple; consider it a concept.\nYou play as a squirrel in a woodland, hoarding nuts before winter sets in. You have to collect 8 nuts in 30 moves or you won’t survive. To make matters worse, there’s an owl on patrol that wants to eat you.\nThe package contains a single ‘ActionSquirrel’ class. It has fields for the location of game objects—emojis for a tree, a squirrel, an owl and a nut—on a grid.1 It has a method to move the squirrel around the grid, which also executes code to assesses and change other field states. For example, it can check how many moves have happened, can adjust the owl’s position and spawn a new nut after the last one was collected."

(It will also help you ‘hack’ the game, more on that later!)\n\nx\n\n&lt;ActionSquirrel&gt;\n  Public:\n    active: TRUE\n    clone: function (deep = FALSE) \n    initialize: function () \n    move: function (where = c(\"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\")) \n    moves: 0\n    n_loc: 8\n    nuts: 0\n    o_loc: 17\n    overworld: 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌰 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🐿 🌳 🌳 🦉 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳\n    pause: function () \n    s_loc: 14\n\n\nThe most relevant of these are the moves and nuts counts; the *_loc values that specify the location of the squirrel, owl and nut in the overworld vector; and the move() method for controlling the player.\n\n\nMove\nYou move the squirrel through the forest with the move() method. It has one argument, where, that takes the directions \"up\", \"down\", \"left\" and \"right\" (you can also just supply the first letter of the direction).\n\nx$move(\"up\")\n\n\f🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌰 🐿️ 🌳 \n🌳 🦉 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \nMoves: 1 \nNuts: 0\n\n\nCongratulations: your move tally has increased by one. You may also have noticed that the owl moved up one space as well; it moves one space vertically or horizontally, or stays still, with equal probability.\nI built in collision detection, so you can’t exceed the limits of the grid by trying to go left if you’re already on the leftmost edge, for example.\nNote that you can also take more than one move at a time (elite gamer tech) by ‘chaining’ methods, like x$move(\"up\")$move(\"left\"), but this is risky because you might collide with the owl.\nImportantly, the whole R console is cleared before the updated grid is printed. This gives an impression of animated graphics, since the console overwrites the previous state with the current state.\nNow to collect the nut.\n\nx$move(\"left\")\n\n\f🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🐿️ 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🦉 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌰 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \nMoves: 2 \nNuts: 1\n\n\nCongratulations, your nut tally has increased by one and a new nut has spawned in a random location. Collect at least eight nuts, or you won’t survive winter.\n\n\nOwl\nYou’ll get a game over if the owl eats you (i.e. you occupy the same spot). So if you move left and the owl happens to move up…\n\nx$move(\"left\")\n\n\f🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 💀 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌰 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \nMoves: 3 \nNuts: 1\nY O U   D I E D ! \nThe owl ate you.\nG A M E   O V E R \n* New game: x &lt;- ActionSquirrel$new() \n* Source:   github.com/matt-dray/ActionSquirrel\n\n\nThe location of your death is marked with a skull and you’ll get a game over with information about what happened. At this point, the active field of the class is set to FALSE, which prevents you from moving again.\n\n\n\nDefinitely it’s harder than Dark Souls.\n\n\n\n\nWinter\nAfter 30 turns the game will end because you’ve reached winter. You’ll get a victory screen if you collected 8 nuts, otherwise a failure screen.\nAside: {R6} allows for ‘public’ and ‘private’ fields and methods. I’ve used public methods for the ActionSquirrel class, so that users can see the contents and state of the class and manipulate them. I think this is good for learning purposes.\nIt also means that we can ‘hack’ the game to the end state by overwriting the number of nuts and moves remaining! First, a victory after having collected eight nuts or more:\n\nx &lt;- ActionSquirrel$new()\n\n\f🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌰 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌳 🐿 🌳 \n🌳 🦉 🌳 🌳 🌳 \n🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 🌳 \nMoves: 0 \nNuts: 0\n\nx$moves &lt;- 29\nx$nuts &lt;- 10\nx$move()\n\n\f🐿️ 💤 🌰 🌰 🌰 \n🌰 🌰 🌰 🌰 🌰 \n🌰 🌰 🎄 ⛄ 🎄 \n🌨 ⛄ 🎄 ⛄ 🎄 \n⛄ ⛄ 🌨 🎄 🌨 \nMoves: 30 \nNuts: 10\nY O U   S U R V I V E D ! \nSufficient winter nut cache!\nG A M E   O V E R \n* New game: x &lt;- ActionSquirrel$new() \n* Source:   github.com/matt-dray/ActionSquirrel\n\n\nOur little squirrel friend is hibernating with the nut cache nearby.

The only thing missing is audio.\nLuckily, you can force your computer to make noise with the {sonify} package. I’ve used it before in this blog to represent COVID-19 data in audio form. For {ActionSquirrel}, I used it to make short, simple beeps to indicate a move, nut capture, collision with the edge of the grid, a win and a death. Here’s what those sound like, respectively:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe death sound is a flatline, because of course it is."

Each of the functions in this section are not exported from the package, but you can access them by prefacing with ghdump::: (the rare triple-colon operator) if you want to see their code.\nFirst, to get repo info:\n\nghd_get_repos() passes a GitHub username to gh::gh(), which contacts the GitHub API to return a gh_response object that contains info about each of that user’s repos\nghd_extract_names() takes the gh_response object from ghd_get_repos() and extracts the names into a character vector\n\nThen to download (if copy_type = \"download\"):\n\nghd_enframe_urls() turns the character vector of repo names into a data.frame, with a corresponding column that contains the URL to a zip file for that repo\nghd_copy_zips() takes each zip file URL from that data frame and downloads them to the file path provided by the user\nghd_unzip() unzips the zipped repos\n\nYou can, of course, use these intermediate functions if you have slightly different needs. Maybe you want to limit the repos that are downloaded; do this by filtering the vector output from ghd_extract_names() for example.\nOr to clone (if copy_type = \"clone\"):\n\nghd_clone_multi() that iterates cloning over the repos, itself calling ghd_clone_one()"

    "text": "Why bother?\nWhat did I learn from doing this? As if I have to explain myuself to you, lol.\n\n1. Iteration\nAside from {gh}, the package also depends on {purrr} for iterative programming.\nFor example, the gh_response object output from ghdump:::ghd_get_repos() is passed to map() with the pluck() function to extract the repo names.\nAnother example is the use of walk(), which is like map(), except we use it when the output is some ‘side effect’. By ‘side effect’, we mean that it doesn’t return an R object. For example, we can walk() the unzip() function over the path to each zip file. This doesn’t return anything in R; it results in some local files being manipulated.\n\n\n2. File manipulation\nR can be used to interact with files on your computer. There’s a number of these base R functions in the package:\n\ndir.create() to create a new folder\nfile.remove() to remove a file or folder\nlist.files() and list.dirs() to return a character vector files and folders at some path\nfile.rename to change the name of a file or folder\nunzip() to unpack a zipped folder\n\n\n\n3. User input\nHow do you ask questions of your user and get answers? This interactivity is made possible by readline(). You pass it a string to prompt the user, whose return value can be stored.\nFor example, this is how it looks in the console:\n\nanswer &lt;- readline(\"Do you like pizza? \") \n\nDo you like pizza? yes\n\nanswer\n\n[1] \"yes\"\nWhere a user has written yes after the prompt on the second line.\n\n\n4. Stickers\nI’ve designed a few hex stickers with the {hexSticker} package; you can see them in my ‘stickers’ GitHub repo. This time I made the sticker for {ghdump} using Dmytro Perepolkin’s {bunny} package, which is a helper for the {magick} package from Jeroen Ooms. It’s a very smooth process with much flexibility."

I focused on R and some specific packages that could be helpful, but the ideas are transferable and there’s lots of ways to achieve the same thing.\nThe things were:\n\n1. Centralise everything\nGet code, functions, data, documentation in one place. Use R Projects in RStudio and write packages. This makes code more shareable and improves the chance that others can recreate things on their machine.\n\n\n2. Report with code\nPut code inside your report so that updates to data and code will be reflected instantly. Use R Markdown and other formats like Yihui Xie’s {xaringan} for reproducible slides and {bookdown} by for reproducible books.\n\n\n3. Manage workflows\nDon’t use your brain to store information about the dependencies within your analysis. Use {drake} by Will Landau instead. It remembers all the relationships between the files, objects and fcuntions in your analysis and only re-runs what needs to be re-run following changes."

It specifically grabs the attached base packages from the sessionInfo() listing. There are other base and ‘recommended’ packages that are actually not attached from the start of your session; see the Priority value from the output of installed.packages().\nNow we can run the function to check the code for the list of function names.\n\nnaughty_words &lt;- find_var_names(\n  code_string = demo_code,\n  names_to_find = get_base_functions()\n)\n\nnaughty_words\n\n   line1 col1 line2 col2 id parent  token terminal text\n12     3    1     3    4 12     14 SYMBOL     TRUE head\n3      2    1     2    4  3      5 SYMBOL     TRUE data\n33     4    8     4    9 33     35 SYMBOL     TRUE   df\n66     6   11     6   11 66     68 SYMBOL     TRUE    c\n\n\nThe output is what you normally get from getparsedata(parse()), filtered for the illegal names. Helpfully it shows you the exact row and column indices for where the string exists in the code you provided.\nAnd of course you can just isolate the offenders.\n\nnaughty_words$text |&gt; unique() |&gt; sort()\n\n[1] \"c\"    \"data\" \"df\"   \"head\"\n\n\nSo the variable names a and b in demo_code were ignored because they’re not function names in base R. And the in-built data sets beaver1 and chickwts were also ignored, because they’re not being used as variable names. And yes, df—a commonly-used variable name for dataframes—is also a function!"

    "title": "Package a {xaringan} template",
    "section": "Create a theme",
    "text": "Create a theme\nThe organisation I work for uses a Google Slides template with pre-set styles and slide layouts. The template was designed with a particular philosophy in mind.\nThe downside is that any R outputs have to be copy-pasted in, which isn’t very reproducible.\nTo overcome this, I recreated their theme for {xaringan} in three steps (click to jump):\n\nCreate styles with CSS\nMake an R Markdown template\nPut these into an R package\n\n\nDo it in style\nCSS lets you define the style of HTML documents, which is the default output for {xaringan}.\nFor {xaringan} you’ll typically need two CSS files:\n\ntheme.css to define the style for each broad slide class (e.g. a heading-slide class) and for general things like table design and hyperlink colours\ntheme-fonts.css to set the typefaces, which you can define separately for the body text, headers, etc\n\nYou reference these files in the YAML header of your {xaringan} R Markdown and the style is enacted when you render it to HTML.\nI tweaked the default {xaringan} CSS files to create my own, which you can see in the the GitHub repo.\nYou can check out the {xaringan} wiki for help and ideas.\n\nGet to class\nI overwrote the default .remark-slide-content class for regular text slides. In other words, failing to specify a class in your {xaringan} slide will result in a text slide by default. I also created title-slide and heading-slide classes.\nHere’s the CSS for defining and styling the very simple heading-slide class:\n\n.heading-slide {\n  background-color: #2372b6;  /* blue background */\n  color: #fff;                /* white text*/\n  text-shadow: 0 0 0;         /* no text shadow */\n  border-bottom: 0;           /* no border */\n  font-size: 90px;            /* large text size */\n  font-weight: bold;          /* headings are bold */\n}\n\n\nAnd here’s how it looks:\n\nYou use it by specifying class: heading-slide in the R Markdown for a {xaringan} slide. You also ass the middle class to make the text vertically centred. This will overwrite the default styles to give you the ‘heading’ slide instead.\n\n\nTag team\nAs well as specifying classes, I’ve added some additional CSS tags that can be used for some minor text modifications:\n\n.black { color: #000; }      /* black text for heading slides */\n.bold { font-weight: bold; } /* embolden name on title/end slides */\n\n\nThese can be used to define different styling for a small part of a slide class. For example, the .black tag is intended for use on heading slides so the default white text can be made darker to contrast with light-coloured backgrounds.\n\n\n\nFace the font\nThe fonts.css is much simpler; it just imports and declares fonts. These can be the default system fonts or can be imported from Google Fonts\n\nMy organisation uses the proprietary Helvetica for its body type. Fortunately the default system sans-serif is Helvetica on a Mac and the close-enough Arial on Windows machines.\nFor the monospace font—used for displaying script—I’ve chosen Fira Mono, which I think is more readable than the default system monospace.\nThe fonts.css file starts by importing from Google Fonts and then describes where they’ll be used. The order of dictates which font will be shown first and then which will be next if there’s a problem.\n\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto');\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fira+Mono');\n\nbody { font-family: sans-serif, 'Roboto'; }\n.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Fira Mono', monospace; }\n\n\nI’ve written a bit before about how to access Google Fonts for Blogdown’s Lithium theme.\n\n\n\nLay down a template\nThe style is not the only important part of recreating my organisation’s presentations. I also need to create an R Markdown template to demonstrate a restricted set of accepted slide designs. The design philosophy is important to the organisation.\nThe template itself is just a pre-filled R Markdown that shows the approved slide types and some example content. For example, the first slide of my organisation’s template doesn’t actually contain a ‘title’. Instead it’s an introduction slide that contains the speaker’s name, job, affiliation and Twitter handle.\nFor example, the user may not know to set class: title-slide and add seal: false in the YAML to override the creation of a default title slide. This is instead pre-specified for the user in the template:\n\n---\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    css: [\"default\", \"gds.css\", \"gds-fonts.css\"]\n    seal: false\n    lib_dir: libs\n    nature:\n      highlightStyle: github\n      highlightLines: true\n      countIncrementalSlides: false\n---\n\nclass: title-slide, middle\n\n.bold[Firstname Surname]\n\nJob title\n\nGovernment Digital Service\n\n@username\n\n---\n\nThe top half of the code is the YAML that provides metadata for the R Markdown file. Note the reference to the CSS files and seal: false as mentioned.\nThe bottom half is the pre-filled opening slide with the speaker’s details; the user needs only to modify the filler text. Note the use of the title-slide class and the middle class for vertical alignment. There’s also the .bold[] tag mentioned earlier in this post.\n\n\nDeliver your package\nSo how can the CSS and R Markdown template be delivered to people in one bundle? In a package of course.\nYou need a specific repo structure to provide your template. This is all explained in the Document Templates chapter of the ‘R Markdown: a Definitive Guide’ book by Yihui Xie, JJ Allaire and Garrett Grolemund.\nAt the very least, your repo will need to contain the path inst/rmarkdown/templates/your-theme/skeleton/, which will typically contain three files:\n\ntheme.css for the slide styles\ntheme-fonts.css for the font face specifications\nskeleton.Rmd for the template you created\n\nI’ve also included an img/ folder to hold stock images I’ve used in the template, but this isn’t strictly necessary.\nYou’ll also need a template.yaml file one level up in inst/rmarkdown/templates/your-theme/. This contains information about the template so users know which one they’re selecting. For example:\n\nname: \"Organisation X template\"\ndescription: Internal slide style for Organisation X\ncreate_dir: false\n\nA user can now install the package and get access to your styles and template.\n\n\nShow the thing\nYou’ve written your code and packaged it, so how do you actually use it?\nIf hosted on GitHub, like my package, you can install it with:\n\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/gdstheme\")\n\nAfter installation the template will appear in the ‘from template’ section of the new R Markdown window. Selecting it will open the R Markdown template.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CSS files referenced in the YAML are used to render the style provided when you knit the document."

RStudio has a feature that lets you execute functions from an ‘addins’ menu.\nLots of of addins are available (see this RStudio Community thread). Some simple ones are {datapasta} for copy-pasting stuff into R, {reprex} for generating reproducible examples and even {blogdown} itself, which has addins for creating new posts and inserting images, for example.\nSo I wrote my snippets into a package that, when installed, adds some functions to RStudio’s addins menu.\nThe package is called {blogsnip}. Visit the site or source. Install with:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/blogsnip\")\n\nOnce installed, the functions are available under ‘BLOGSNIP’ in RStudio’s ‘addins’ dropdown (see the gif at the top of this post). You could also use them like regular functions by calling blogsnip::addin_details(), for example."

In which case, the (simplified) steps are:\n\nCreate an R package structure with usethis::create_package()\nAdd an R script to house your functions with usethis::use_r()\nEdit the script so you have functions in the form fun_name &lt;- function() {rstudioapi::insertText(\"Text\")}, where the insertText() function does exactly that (see example)\nAdd a special file at inst/rstudio/addins.dcf that declares your functions as addins (see example)\nDocument and build your package and host it for others to use\n\nSo you’re writing an R package as usual2, making use of {rstudioapi} functions and adding that special .dcf file.\nSee what this looks like in the full source code for {blogsnip} (note that I’ve added some other stuff there, like a license, readme and files to generate a {pkgdown} site)."

There are Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to help achieve this and many (often free) tools for checking accessibility issues.

They’re particularly helpful for blind and partially-sighted people.\nImages are declared in the HTML code of a website with the &lt;img&gt; element. Like other HTML tags, it can have many ‘attributes’: the source of the image (where the image is actually hosted), the height and width of the image, and so on.\nThe ‘alt’ attribute provides alternative text that describes the image. This text won’t be visible to people visiting the page (unless you right-click and ‘inspect’ the HTML for the page), but will be picked up screen readers.\n\n\nWhen and what to write\nWhat should you actually write as alternative text for an image?

    "text": "Chancellor of the {altcheckr}\nI’ve been writing different sorts of R packages recently (see posts on {usethis}, {kevinbacran}, {blogsnip} and {gdstheme}) and I’ve have also written briefly on accessibility and some related tools.\nTo this end, I’ve written a small R package called {altcheckr} to help assess alt text programmatically. Go to the source on GitHub or see the site built with {pkgdown}.\nNote that {altcheckr} isn’t intended to provide a definitive evaluation of alt text. It uses simple heuristics and doesn’t contain everything that could be checked. I’m not an expert and the package isn’t user tested.\nIt has only two functions for now:\n\nalt_get() scrapes the web page at a URL provided by the user and outputs a data frame where each row is an image and each column is an HTML attribute\nalt_check() takes the output from alt_get() and adds a series of columns that assess features of the alt text, like its length\n\nIt also contains the example_get data set, which is a dummy output from alt_get() to be used to experiment with alt_check().\n\nExample\nLet’s walk through how you can get the package, fetch alt text from a webpage and then assess it.\n\nInstall\nYou can get the package from GitHub with:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\ninstall_github(\"matt-dray/altcheckr\")\nlibrary(altcheckr)\n\n\n\nalt_get()\nThe alt_get() function makes use of {polite}, {xml2} and {rvest} to scrape a web page and isolate attributes from its &lt;img&gt; elements. If {polite} determines that it’s okay to scrape, alt_get() returns a tibble after some {purrr} wrangling, where each row is an image. You can choose to retain all scraped attributes as columns, or it defaults to returning just src and alt (longdesc too if it exists).\nWe’ll use the BBC News home page as our example. A popular site with constantly-updating content that you would expect to have good alt text.\n\n\n\nBBC News sports section. How would you describe these images in alt text?\n\n\nPass the web page’s URL to alt_get() to return a tibble where each row is an image from the page and there are columns for the image source (src) and alt text (alt).\n\nbbc_get &lt;- alt_get(\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news\")\nstr(bbc_get)\n\nClasses 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    105 obs. of  2 variables:\n$ src: chr  \"https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=unknown&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:b5c53243-a695-e059-e\"| __truncated__ \"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14E0/production/_98244350_pa.jpg\" \"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" \"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" ...\n$ alt: chr  \"\" \"The Irish border\" \"Airman Mohammad Sameh Haitham (left) and ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson\" \"Crowds\" ...\nA whopping 105 images!

Let’s do a simple assessment of the alt text using the alt_check() function to provide a bit more information.\n\n\nalt_check()\nThe alt_check() function takes the output from alt_get() and generates some new variables based on the alt text.\n\nbbc_check &lt;- alt_check(bbc_get)\n\npackagelibrary(dplyr)\nglimpse(bbc_check)\n\nObservations: 105\nVariables: 10\n$ src            &lt;chr&gt; \"https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&…\n$ alt            &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"The Irish border\", \"Airman Mohammad Sameh Ha…\n$ alt_exists     &lt;chr&gt; \"Empty\", \"Exists\", \"Exists\", \"Exists\", \"Exists\", …\n$ nchar_count    &lt;int&gt; NA, 16, 67, 6, 28, 92, 37, 16, 14, 38, 4, 10, 26,…\n$ nchar_assess   &lt;chr&gt; NA, \"Short\", \"OK\", \"Short\", \"OK\", \"OK\", \"OK\", \"Sh…\n$ file_ext       &lt;lgl&gt; NA, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FAL…\n$ self_evident   &lt;lgl&gt; NA, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FAL…\n$ terminal_punct &lt;lgl&gt; NA, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FAL…\n$ spellcheck     &lt;list&gt; [&lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;\"Sameh\", \"Haitham\", \"Kaleb\"&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;\"We…\n$ not_basic      &lt;list&gt; [&lt;&gt;, &lt;\"irish\", \"border\"&gt;, &lt;\"airman\", \"mohammad\",…\nYou can see a number of new columns in addition to src and alt that were output from alt_get(). These are as follows, with reasoning:\n\n\n\nColumn name\nWhat\nWhy\n\n\n\n\nalt_exists\nHas alt text been provided?\nA lack of alt text could be a problem, though it’s acceptable if the image is decorative.\n\n\nnchar_count\nNumber of characters in the alt text.\nUsed in nchar_assess\n\n\nnchar_assess\nCategorical. Whether the alt text is ‘short’ (defaults to 20 characters), ‘long’ (125) or ‘okay’.\nShort alt text might not describe the image well, but is acceptable for things like buttons, for example. Long alt text might be too verbose and should probably put in a longdesc attribute.\n\n\nfile_ext\nLogical. Does the alt text appear to be a file name?\nAlt text shouldn’t contain a file name.\n\n\nself_evident\nLogical. Does the alt text contain redundant phrases?\nIt doesn’t need to say ‘a picture showing…’ or similar.\n\n\nterminal_punct\nLogical. Does the alt text end in terminal punctuation?\nThe alt text should end in a sentence terminator, like a full stop. This means the screen reader will parse it as a proper sentence.\n\n\nspellcheck\nA listcol of character vectors detailing misspelled words according to hunspell from the {hunspell} package.\nErrors in spelling may result in the screen reader misreading a word.\n\n\nnot_basic\nA listcol of character vectors that aren’t in Charles Kay Ogden’s Basic English list.\nText is more accessible in general if it uses simple English.\n\n\n\nI’d like to hear your thoughts on these variables and if you’d like to suggest others. Contributions to the GitHub repository are very welcome.\n\n\n\nInterpret the data\nYou can take the output from alt_check() and investigate further. Here’s two very simple and plainly-presented examples.\nLet’s look first at the length of the alt text. This histogram shows the distribution of character counts coloured by the nchar_assess variable, giving different colours to alt text that’s under 20 (‘short’) or over 125 (‘long’) characters.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nbbc_check %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(nchar_count)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    aes(fill = nchar_assess),\n    binwidth = 5, \n    na.rm = TRUE\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of character lengths in image alt text\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"BBC News home page,\", Sys.Date()),\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news via the {altcheckr} package\",\n    x = \"Character count\", y = \"Count\"\n  ) + theme_classic() + theme(legend.title = element_blank())\n\n\nSo you can there’s see a lot of short alt text that might need looking at if the images are meant to be informative. For example, here’s the 10 shortest:\n\nbbc_check %&gt;%\n  filter(nchar_count &lt; 20) %&gt;%\n  arrange(nchar_count) %&gt;%\n  distinct(alt, nchar_count) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 x 2\nalt          nchar_count\n&lt;chr&gt;              &lt;int&gt;\n1 Fred                   4\n2 Santa                  5\n3 Crowds                 6\n4 Celeste                7\n5 Pork pie               8\n6 Liam Payne            10\n7 quiz promo            10\n8 Tie fighter           11\n9 Jamie Vardy           11\n10 Emma Spencer          12\nNext: how does the alt text of images make use of terminal punctuation (period, exclamation point or question mark)?\n\nbbc_check %&gt;%\n  group_by(terminal_punct) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n()) %&gt;%  # count within the variable\n  ggplot(aes(x = terminal_punct, y = Count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Existence of terminal punctuation (., !, ?) in alt text\",\n    subtitle = paste(\"BBC News home page,\", Sys.Date()),\n    caption = \"Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news via the {altcheckr} package\",\n    x = \"Terminal punctuation exists\", \n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) + theme_classic() +\n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_classic()\n\n\nSo most of the alt text does not end in terminal punctuation (FALSE), which is a bit disappointing. This means a screen reader might not fully parse the image as a complete sentence.\nNote that the findings here aren’t definitive and each case would need to be looked further into. However, these very shallow analyses imply that there are some improvements to make.\n\n\nNext steps\nThere’s a number of alt_check() additions that could be developed. For example:\n\noptical character recognition (OCR) to decide whether an image has text in it, and to possibly extract it\nguess the type of image based on its attributes and derived variables (a functional image might have relatively small height and width attributes, for example)\nassess the text in the link provided by the longdesc attribute, if it exists\ndetect ‘link stuffing’, where alt text is filed with keywords for purposes of search engine optimisation\n\nAnd of course: better unit testing and test coverage, simplifying the dependencies (there’s lots) and making the code more efficient. Tell me about other things that can be improved.\nUltimately, my call to action for R users is to explore the wealth of materials for package development1 and for everyone to take a moment to think about your users and the accessibility of whatever you’re producing."

What’s the relationship between the two gallon units?\nFirst install and attach the {units} package, which is available on CRAN. It will print the location where the units dataset is stored. These units are derived from the comprehensive UNIDATA udunits database, which has all the relevant SI units and some that are a little more… nonstandard.\n\n# install.packages(\"units\")  # install if you haven't already\nlibrary(units)\n\nudunits database from /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/library/units/share/udunits/udunits2.xml\n\n\nI’ll also load a few other packages for the purposes of this post.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(dplyr)\n  library(stringr)\n  library(purrr)\n})\n\nYou can inspect the valid_units() dataframe to find out what units you can work with. Here’s five random units from the dataframe:\n\nvalid_udunits() %&gt;% \n  filter(symbol != \"\" & name_singular != \"\") %&gt;% \n  sample_n(5) %&gt;% \n  select(symbol, name_singular, definition)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  symbol name_singular      definition                                          \n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;                                               \n1 H      henry              unit of inductance; where a circuit's current chang…\n2 L      liter              unit of capacity equal to 1000 cubic centimeters    \n3 in     international_inch unit of length equal to 25.4 mm by definition, used…\n4 °F     fahrenheit         unit of thermodynamic temperature                   \n5 '      arc_minute         measurement of a plane angle equal to 1/60 arc degr…\n\n\nWe can filter the name_singular column to find the available gallon units.\n\ndplyr::filter(\n  valid_udunits(),\n  str_detect(name_singular, \"gallon\")\n) %&gt;% \n  select(name_singular)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 1\n  name_singular         \n  &lt;chr&gt;                 \n1 Canadian_liquid_gallon\n2 US_dry_gallon         \n3 US_liquid_gallon      \n4 UK_liquid_gallon      \n\n\nWe’re interested in UK_liquid_gallon and US_liquid_gallon, but wow, there’s two more, including a ‘dry’ one.\nWe can supply a unit to a value with as_units(), so we can create 1 UK gallon with the following:\n\nuk_gal &lt;- as_units(1, \"UK_liquid_gallon\")\n\nThat gives us an object with class units and the print method adds the unit in square brackets:\n\nclass(uk_gal)\n\n[1] \"units\"\n\nuk_gal\n\n1 [UK_liquid_gallon]\n\n\nWe can also do maths with these objects:\n\nuk_gal + uk_gal\n\n2 [UK_liquid_gallon]\n\n\nAnd to convert it, we can take set the units of our unit-class object and specify a different unit. The units need to be compatible though, so you can’t convert a gallon to a parsec, for example.\n\n# Using purrr::safely() to capture the error\nsafe_set_units &lt;- safely(set_units)\nsafe_set_units(uk_gal, \"parsec\")$error\n\n&lt;simpleError: cannot convert UK_liquid_gallon into parsec&gt;\n\n\nThis prevents you from combining non-compatible units, which is a real danger if your data is stored as bare numeric values with no unit information.\nAnd now we’ll set the new units for the gallon-to-gallon conversion.\n\nus_gal &lt;- set_units(uk_gal, \"US_liquid_gallon\")\nus_gal\n\n1.20095 [US_liquid_gallon]\n\n\nSo a UK liquid gallon is about 20% larger than a US one. But I thought everything was meant to be larger in the US!"

    "text": "Herring aid\nWho doesn’t like getting lost in the Wikipedia rabbithole? I came upon the page for ‘cran’ and found it amusing that the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) package database had a rival.\nWhat’s a cran, then? Well, an antiquated legal unit for measuring the volume of landed, uncleaned herring in the North Sea fishing industry. Also used as the name for a basket that could carry that volume.1\nIt sounds like the initial 18th-century measurement was volumetric and inexact, equalling something like 1200 fish. Later this was made official in terms of ‘wine gallons’, with Wikipedia pegging it to 170.5 litres in more modern units. For confirmation, simply read the Second Report of the Commissioners Appointed by His Majesty to Consider the Subject of Weights and Measures, 1820:\n\nNaturally, I checked valid_udunits()… and cran isn’t in there. So obviously I needed to make it.\nYou can basically do this in three steps with {units}: define a new unit based on known units; create a unit object; convert it to the newly-defined unit.\nSo, you can ‘install’ a new unit with reference to another unit by multiplying or offsetting by some constant. In our case, our new unit is equal to 170.5 litres.\n\ninstall_unit(\"cran\", \"170.5 L\")\n\nNow we can work with the cran unit. Let’s first create a unit-class object to convert. For example, we can confirm that 170.5 litres is equal to one cran.\n\none_litre &lt;- as_units(170.5, \"L\")\none_litre\n\n170.5 [L]\n\n\nWe can supply this to the set_units() function and specify we want it converted to cran.\n\nset_units(one_litre, \"cran\")\n\n1 [cran]\n\n\n\nCRAN… no, {cran}\nSo I created a package called {cran} that contains this conversion. You can install it from GitHub using the {remotes} package. Except, you know, don’t, because you have no need for it unless you’re an 18th century fisherman.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/cran\")\n\nAnd then when you load the package it asks if you want to create the cran unit. Answering ‘yes’ results in the cran unit being available in your session.\n\nlibrary(cran)\n\nCreate the 'cran' unit of measurement for this session? yes/no: yes\nYou're ready to measure uncleaned herring.\nNow you can use cran for setting and converting units. So we can revisit our check that 170.5 litres equals 1 cran:\n\ncran::cran_convert(170.5, \"L\")\n\n1 [cran]\n\n\n…And that’s it, basically. You can remove and reinstall the unit at any point with cran_remove() and cran_install().\n\ncran::cran_remove()\n\nRemove the 'cran' unit of measurement for this session? yes/no: yes\nYou're done measuring uncleaned herring."

So ‘build passing’ means that the code in the latest update is working. Clicking the badge will take you to the associated site to get more information.\nOther badges are static and can act as a handy link.

I could just link to the post in the README—I often do—but the badge sits at the top of the README and is eye-catching. It’s also a useful at-a-glance reminder for me when I’m looking over my repos.\nThe rest of this post lays out how you can build one for yourself.\n\nshields.io\nFortunately, There’s a service called shields.io that makes it easy to create a simple badge. It works by exposing a badge with parameters you provide in a URL string.\nYou can generate a simple static badge by modifying a URL string in the form https://img.shields.io/badge/&lt;LABEL&gt;-&lt;MESSAGE&gt;-&lt;COLOR&gt;.\nSo ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/label-message-red) results in this:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could build on this by providing an alternative style and an image from Simple Icons.\nFor example, ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/label-message-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github) results in this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you can see that additional ‘arguments’ to the basic call are added after a ? and then additional parts added with an &.\n\n\n{badgr}\nThis got me thinking about a quick R function to build up a badge URL. This became the get_badge() function in the {badgr} package. This is currently a bit janky and untested, but so far it does what I want it to do.\nYou can install it with:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_githb(\"matt-dray/badgr\")\n\nget_badge() builds up the components of a shields.io-valid URL given the arguments you provide. For example, you can specify the text (label and message arguments) and background colour to go on either side of the badge (label_color and color). You can also include a logo from simpleicons.org (logo_simple) or a custom icon of your choosing (logo_path).\nThe most complex part is that the path to the custom logo has to be base64-encoded, which is done with base64enc::base64encode(). The output from that is then passed into the shields.io URL.\nBy default, the function wraps your badge in Markdown in the form [![](&lt;shields.io URL&gt;)](&lt;provided link&gt;) and copies it to your clipboard, ready for you to paste it into a README somewhere. It also sends the URL to your browser for a preview.\n\n\nA rostrum.blog badge\nSo, I made a badge that has:\n\n‘rostrum.blog’ on the left side, with a black background\n‘post’ on the right side with a green background (to match the green used on this site)\nthe rostrum.blog ‘bug’ logo gif (used as the favicon for the site)2\n\nI achieved that with the following code:\n\n# Set path to custom logo (a gif in this case)\nlogo &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/master/static/images/favicon.gif\"\n\n# Set underlying badge link (where the badge-click will take you)\nlink &lt;- \"https://www.rostrum.blog/\"\n\nblog_badge &lt;- badgr::get_badge(\n  label = \"rostrum.blog\",   # left-side text\n  message = \"post\",         # right-side text\n  color = \"008900\",         # left-side colour (green)\n  label_color = \"black\",    # right_side colour\n  md_link = link,           # where to go when clicked\n  logo_path = logo,         # path to my logo\n  browser_preview = FALSE,  # don't open preview\n  to_clipboard = FALSE      # don't copy to clipboard\n)\n\nThat results in the following string output:\n\nblog_badge\n\n[1] \"[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/rostrum.blog-post-008900?style=flat&labelColor=black&logo=data:image/gif;base64,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)](https://www.rostrum.blog/)\"\n\n\nThis is a shields.io-valid URL encased in some Markdown that allows it to be pasted directly into a GitHub README, for example. See how the Markdown contains the ![]() image declaration, which itself is wrapped in the []() link declaration. This means that clicking the link will take you to the URL specified by the md_link argument to get_badge().\nIt looks like this when rendered:\n\n\nNote that the icon is subtly animated (the bug antennae open and close) because the source image was a gif.\n\n Note\nWhen I re-rendered this post with Quarto in 2023, the logos in the rostrum.blog badge and the GitHub ‘label message’ badge were inexplicably missing (but not in the Shiny badge below). I’ve temporarily replaced these badges with screenshots until I can understand and fix the problem.\n\n\n\n Note\nMore recently I’ve realised that it would be handy to have a README badge to indicate that one of my repos contains a Shiny app and whether it’s available on the internet. The right-hand side of the badge can point out whether the app is live (e.g. on shinyapps.io) or ‘not hosted’. For example:"

What do people put in them? Is there anything funny in them? Anything nefarious?"

    "text": "A strong attachment\nA package may need to run additional code before its functions can work, like maybe some options() need to be set.\nThere are two times this kind of code can be run: when the package is loaded, including namespace calls like dplyr::select(), or more specifically when the package is attached with library().\nTo prepare code for running on-load or on-attach, you create the special functions .onLoad() and .onAttach(). These go in a zzz.R file in the R/ directory of your package, because… convention?\nThe on-attach option is useful for printing messages for the user to see in the console, like the {multicolor} example above. You want this to happen on-attach and not on-load, since you wouldn’t want to print a message every single your script uses the :: namespace qualifier.\nTo specify a message in the body of your .onAttach() function, you use packageStartupMessage(). Why not just cat() or message()? Because it allows the user to quell startup messages using suppressPackageStartupMessages().\nYou can learn more in Hadley Wickham’s R Packages book.\nAs an example, consider the {tidyverse} package, which has some verbose output on attach:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nBut you can shush it with the suppressPackageStartupMessages() function:1\n\ndetach(\"package:tidyverse\")  # first detach it\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\n\nPeace.\nSo the startup messages of {multicolor} and {tidyverse} do two completely different things: one is fun and frivolous and the other is informative. Isn’t it possible that someone could put ads in the startup message or use it in evil ways? Well, perhaps.\nLet’s find out what R package developers put in their startup messages. How many packages even have a zzz.R file and how many of those even contain a packageStartupMessage() call?"

    "text": "Catching some Zs\nI understand if all this talk of zzz.R causes you to… zzz. In short, if you want to get all the zzz.R files, you can:\n\nGet a list of R packages on CRAN\nIdentify which ones have an associated GitHub repo\nGet the default branch name of each one and construct the possible URL to their zzz.R file\nContact the possible zzz.R file to see if it exists\nIf it exists, download it\nFilter for zzz.R files that contain packageStartupMessage()\n\nWe’ve already attached the tidyverse packages, but we’ll also need two more packages:\n\nlibrary(gh)    # interact with GitHub API\nlibrary(httr)  # requests via the internet \n\n\n Note\nIf you’re thinking this approach is a bit long-winded, you’re right. As Tim pointed out, we could just extract the info via METACRAN, an unofficial CRAN mirror hosted on GitHub. It even has its own API. I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.\n\n\nPackages\nLuckily you can grab info for all current CRAN packages with the very handy CRAN_package_db() function.2\n\ncran_pkgs &lt;- as_tibble(tools::CRAN_package_db())\n\nThis returns a dataframe containing 19865 rows, where each one is a package, along with 67 variables. We get information like the stuff that’s found in package DESCRIPTION files, but it doesn’t tell us whether a package has a zzz.R file.\nOne way to do this is to visit the GitHub repo associated with the package, if it has one, and see if a zzz.R exists. Of course, many packages are not on GitHub, but we’re going to ignore those for simplicity.\n\n Note\nI re-rendered this post in July 2023, so the output no longer reflects CRAN as it was when this post was published (August 2021).\n\n\n\n\nGithub repos\nA quick way of discovering if a package has a GitHub repo is to check for ‘github.com’ in the BugReports section of it DESCRIPTION file.3 Again, this doesn’t capture all the possible repos, but is fine for now.\n\nhas_repo &lt;- cran_pkgs %&gt;% \n  select(Package, BugReports) %&gt;% \n  filter(str_detect(BugReports, \"github\")) %&gt;% \n  transmute(\n    Package,\n    owner_repo = str_extract(\n      str_replace_all(paste0(BugReports, \"/x\"), \"//\", \"/\"),\n      \"(?&lt;=github.com/).*(?=/[a-zA-Z])\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;% \n  separate(owner_repo, c(\"owner\", \"repo\"), \"/\") %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(Package), !is.na(owner), !is.na(repo)) %&gt;% \n  distinct(Package, owner, repo) %&gt;% \n  arrange(Package) \n\nsample_n(has_repo, 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  Package     owner          repo       \n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;      \n1 MatrixEQTL  andreyshabalin MatrixEQTL \n2 mitre       motherhack3r   mitre      \n3 path.chain  krzjoa         path.chain \n4 shinyXYpad  stla           shinyXYpad \n5 netdiffuseR USCCANA        netdiffuseR\n\n\nThere were 19865 CRAN packages total and now we have 8152 (41%) that appear to have a GitHub repo.\nIf you’re wondering why we didn’t just use the package name as the repo name, it’s because they sometimes don’t match, e.g. {baseballDBR} is in a repo called ‘moneyball’.\nNow we can use the repo details to build a URL to a potential zzz.R URL. This comes in the form https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;defaultbranch&gt;/R/zzz.R\".\n\n\nDefault branch\nYou’ll notice we don’t yet know the default branch of the package’s GitHub repo. Historically, we could probably have just hard-coded ‘master’, but the automatic default is now ‘main’. And of course, the default branch could be something else entirely.\nWe can grab the default branch for each repo from the GitHub API using the excellent {gh} package by Gábor Csárdi, Jenny Bryan and Hadley Wickham. You’ll need to do some setup to use it yourself.\nThe key function is gh(), to which you can pass a GET request for the information we want: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}. We can iterate for each repo by passing each owner and repo name in turn. It returns a list object with lots of information about the repo.\nI’ve created ‘possibly’ function variants with {purrr} so that any errors in the process are handled by returning NA, rather than breaking the loop, which would kill the process.\n\n# Create 'try' function versions\nmap2_possibly &lt;- possibly(map2, NA_real_)\ngh_possibly &lt;- possibly(gh, NA_real_)\n\n# Function: fetch repo details, print message on action\nget_repo &lt;- function(owner, repo) {\n  cat(paste0(\"[\", Sys.time(), \"]\"), paste0(owner, \"/\", repo), \"\\n\")\n  gh_possibly(\"GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}\", owner = owner, repo = repo) \n}\n\nmaybe_zzz &lt;- has_repo %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    repo_deets =  map2_possibly(\n      has_repo$owner, has_repo$repo, get_repo\n    )\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    default_branch = map(\n      repo_deets, ~pluck(.x, \"default_branch\")\n    ),\n    default_branch = pluck(default_branch, 1),\n    zzz_url = paste0(\n      \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\",\n      owner, \"/\", repo, \"/\", default_branch, \"/R/zzz.R\"\n    )\n  )\n\nSo now we have a column with the returned repo information, the extracted default branch name and a URL that points to a potential zzz.R file in that repo.\n\nhead(maybe_zzz)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  Package      owner           repo         repo_deets default_branch zzz_url   \n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;list&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 AATtools     Spiritspeak     AATtools     &lt;gh_rspns&gt; master         https://r…\n2 ABHgenotypeR StefanReuscher  ABHgenotypeR &lt;gh_rspns&gt; master         https://r…\n3 ABM          junlingm        ABM          &lt;gh_rspns&gt; master         https://r…\n4 ACEP         agusnieto77     ACEP         &lt;gh_rspns&gt; master         https://r…\n5 ACNE         HenrikBengtsson ACNE         &lt;gh_rspns&gt; master         https://r…\n6 ACWR         JorgeDelro      ACWR         &lt;gh_rspns&gt; master         https://r…\n\n\n\n\nStatus codes\nNow we can check the status code for each of the URLs we’ve built. A return of 200 tells us that the file exists and 404 means it doesn’t.4 Again, we can prevent the loop breaking on error by creating a ‘possibly’ version of map().\n\nlibrary(httr)  # for status_code()\n\nmap_possibly &lt;- possibly(map, NA_character_)\n\nmaybe_zzz_status &lt;- maybe_zzz %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    status = map_possibly(\n      zzz_url, ~status_code(GET(.x))\n    )\n  ) %&gt;% \n  unnest(status)\n\ncount(maybe_zzz_status, status)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  status     n\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1    200  1519\n2    404  6631\n\n\nOkay, great, we’ve got over a thousand zzz.R files.\n\n\nRead content\nNow we know which packages have a zzz.R file, we can use readLines() to grab their content from their URL, which again we can protect from errors with purrr::possibly().\nNote that I’ve created a special version of readLines() that reports to the user the path being checked, but also has a random delay. This is to dampen the impact on GitHub’s servers.\n\n# Function: readLines() but with a pause and message\nreadLines_delay &lt;- function(path) {\n  sample(1:3, 1)\n  cat(paste0(\"[\", Sys.time(), \"]\"), path, \"\\n\")\n  readLines(path, warn = FALSE)\n}\n\nreadLines_delay_possibly &lt;- possibly(readLines_delay, NA_character_)\n\nfosho_zzz &lt;- maybe_zzz_status %&gt;% \n  select(-repo_deets) %&gt;% \n  filter(status == 200) %&gt;%  # just the \n  mutate(lines = map_possibly(zzz_url, readLines_delay_possibly))\n\ndim(fosho_zzz)\n\nSo now we have a dataframe with a row per package and a list-column containing the R code in the zzz.R file.\n\n\nStartup messages\nFinally, we can find out which packages have a packageStartupMessage() call inside their zzz.R.\n\nhas_psm &lt;- fosho_zzz %&gt;% \n  select(Package, lines) %&gt;%\n  unnest(lines) %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(lines, \"packageStartupMessage\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(lines = str_remove_all(lines, \" \")) %&gt;%\n  distinct(Package) %&gt;% \n  pull()\n\nfosho_psm &lt;- filter(fosho_zzz, Package %in% has_psm)\n\nSo we started with 19865 CRAN packages and have winnowed it to down to 579 (3%) that have a call to packageStartupMessage() in their zzz.R.\n\n\nTable of results\nI could provide a table with all the zzz.R content, but I don’t want to break any licenses by reproducing them all here. Instead, here’s an interactive table that links to the GitHub page for each zzz.R file that appears to have a package startup message.\n\n\nClick for table code\n\n\nlibrary(reactable)\n\nreactable(\n  data = fosho_psm %&gt;% \n    select(package = Package, owner, url = zzz_url),\n  searchable = TRUE,\n  paginationType = \"jump\",\n  defaultPageSize = 10,\n  columns = list(\n    url = colDef(cell = function(value) {\n      htmltools::tags$a(href = value, target = \"_blank\", \"zzz.R\")\n    })\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Note\nI re-rendered this post in July 2023, so the table above may contain different packages to when it was first published. The section below relates to the originally-published post and may no longer reflect the content of the zzz.R files listed in the table above.\n\n\n\nPatterns\nI had a scan through the scripts and found some frequent uses of packageStartupMessages() to:\n\nshow a basic salutation (e.g. {afex})\nshow the version number, a check to see if the user has the latest version, sometimes a prompt to download the latest version for them (e.g. {vistributions}), sometimes a note that the package has been superseded by another (e.g. {drake})\nlinks to guidance, examples, documentation (e.g. {bayesplot})\nprovide a citation or author names (e.g. {unvotes})\nlink to issue tracking or bug reporting (e.g. {timeperiodsR})\ncheck for required supplementary software (e.g. {DALY})\nremind of the need for credentials or keys for packages that access APIS, for example (e.g. {trainR})\nprovide terms of use, warranties, licenses, etc (e.g. {emmeans})\n\nI was also interested to see:\n\na random tip, so you get something new each time you attach the package (e.g. {shinyjs})\nappeals for GitHub stars (e.g. {sigminer})\nlinks to purchasable course materials (e.g. {anomalise})\n\nAnd perhaps the most self-aware were several packages that reminded the user that they can turn off startup messages with suppressPackageStartupMessages() if the messages get too annoying (e.g. {dendextend}).\nA few interesting specifics (possible spoiler alerts!):\n\n{bayestestR} and {sjmisc} have displays a special Star Wars message on a certain day of the year…\n{SHT} and {symengine} load ASCII art, as does {BetaBit}, which also prompts the user for a game they’d like to play\n{depigner} says ‘Welcome to depigner: we are here to un-stress you!’\n{mde} has a friendly ‘Happy Exploration :)’ salutation and {manymodelr} says ‘Happy Modelling! :)’\n{sjPLot} says ‘#refugeeswelcome’\n\nYou can use the interactive table above to reach each of the zzz.R files for these packages, or have a sift through yourself to see what you can find."

You might get asked for this if someone is diagnosing your R problem. You may also see it at the end of blog posts or reports.\nYou might typically print this to the console with the base function sessionInfo(), but it gives a lot of information by default. Other functions have been created to make the output more friendly.\n\n\nThis post\nI’ve been using sessionInfo(), but read about Yihui’s session_info() function in his {xfun} package and saw Mat at machinegurning.com using session_info() from {devtools}.\nI want to see the outputs side-by-side for my own curiosity."

You get basically what’s in sessionInfo()\n\nsections split into ‘session info’ and ‘packages’\nversion, system, UI, language, locale, timezone and date\npackage names with version number, date and source (CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub, local)\n\nIt’s even more human-readable in the packages section, where the output is in table format and in alphabetical order. In particular, there’s a column to tell you where the package came from. For example, see how the {helminthR} package is from github (ropensci/helminthR@549957a) (i.e. the development version with a specific Git ref hash) and there’s an asterisk in the row to show you it was attached in the session.\n\n\nClick to expand the output from this function\n\n\ndevtools::session_info()\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n

Using {xfun}\nFrom Yihui Xie’s Introduction to {xfun} page:\n\n…it is rarely useful to print out the names of base R packages, or information about the matrix products / BLAS / LAPACK. Often times I want additional information in the session information, such as the Pandoc version when rmarkdown is used.\n\nWhat do you get? Basically utils::sessionInfo() but no matrix products, BLAS or LAPACK info, plus all the packages are listed together with their version numbers. You also can’t see where the package came from (CRAN, GitHub or Bioconductor). It lacks some human-readability compared to the functions in {devtools} and {sessioninfo}, but is clearly enough for Yihui – his package contains ‘miscellaneous functions that [he] use[s] by [him]self from time to time’.\n\n\nClick to expand the output from this function\n\n\nxfun::session_info()\n\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS

    "text": "Tidy Tuesday\nTidy Tuesday is an open event for the R community. The organisers provide a data set and participants submit their take on wrangling and presenting the data, usually via Twitter with the hashtag #tidytuesday.\nA recent data set (week 19) via VillagerDB includes information about villager non-player characters from the wildly popular Animal Crossing: New Horizons game for the Nintendo Switch. A similar set of data was also uploaded to Kaggle.\nI couldn’t resist, having recently written about learning R6 object-oriented programming with an Animal Crossing example.\nThis was also a good chance to learn more about two packages in particular: {shinysense} and {googlesheets4}.\n\n{shinysense}\nNick Strayer‘s {shinysense} package lets Shiny ’sense the world around it’, with modules for touch, vision, hearing and motion.\nI wanted to try out shinyswipr, which presents a user with a ‘card’ that they can swipe. The direction of swiping can be used to indicate something, like a preference. After swiping, the card content can be updated.\nYou can read Nick’s blog post about its inception.\n\n\n{googlesheets4}\nIn Nick’s shinyswipr example, he presents back to the user their swipe history, but how can we record the information from all users and return the collated results?\nThere’s a number of ways to do persistent storing with Shiny, but a relatively simple one is to write the data to Google Sheets and read the entire sheet back into the app.\nThe {googlesheets4} package by Jenny Bryan helps you do exactly that, with functions like sheet_append() and read_sheet()."

On mobile you can swipe left or right with your finger. On desktop you can click and drag the card.\n\n\n\nNo dates guaranteed. The characters aren’t actually real, y’see.\n\n\nThe swipe event results in the information being written to a Google Sheet and triggers the entirety of the updated data set to be read back to the app. It’s then wrangled lightly and the information is presented as a table of the current top 10 villagers by ‘like’ count. Finally, a new random villager is presented.\nThis is obviously a bit of fun and definitely not polished. Do let me know of any bugs that you find, though. I’m aware that mobiles may not display the fonts correctly, for example.\n\nData and hosting\nNo data about the user is stored. The app records only the date-time, the villager name and the swipe direction.\nThe app is hosted for free on shinyapps.io, so there’s a limited number of uptime hours it can use per month."

In government we’re using a code-based approach called Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) to automate and make reproducible our statistical publications; speeding up our work while reducing error and building confidence.\nR has many packages that help with reproducibility. Take a look at the CRAN Task View for some examples.\nR Markdown is a particularly useful and ubiquitous tool. It allows you to execute R code inside your document and ‘knit’ it into a readable report with the {knitr} package by Yihui Xie. You can re-run the code, or alter the parameters and re-knit it without stress. This is much faster and less error-prone versus a workflow that moves data between a database, spreadsheet and word processor.\nThe R Markdown bible has been released recently by Yihui Xie, JJ Allaire and Garrett Grolemund and is the go-to resource for creating reports, presentations, dashboards, websites, books and blogs in R Markdown."

Knitting Club\nKnitting Club is a document about R Markdown and {knitr} made with R markdown and {knitr}. It’s freely available on the web and you can find the code on GitHub.\nI presented this document in a cross-department Coffee & Coding session in April 2018. The blurb was:\n\nDo you have woolly knowledge of document creation in R? Needle little help? Matt Dray will drop some purls of wisdom and unravel a yarn about the knitty-gritty of R Markdown and the ‘knitr’ package for one-click document creation. Don’t get the point? If a deadline is looming, you’ll avoid a stitch-up from endless re-running of code and copy-pasting of outputs into a Word document. Come along and have a ball!\n\nHa.\n\n\n2.

See the package’s readme for examples.\nYou can install the development version from GitHub:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"seankross/postcards\")\n\nI generated an R Markdown file with the ‘Jolla’ template using the following line:\n\nrmarkdown::draft(\"index.Rmd\", \"Jolla\", package = \"postcards\")\n\nNote that the file is called index.Rmd and will thus render to index.html. This is the default file that gets read when a site is visited.\nIn the YAML header of the template you can specify a title, which is likely to be your name; the output format, which is the name for our chosen {postcards} template; links, where you specify the wording and underlying links for the page’s buttons; image for your bokeh-rich professional headshot and favicon for the little image that will appear alongside your page title in a browser tab. \n---\ntitle: \"Matt Dray\"\nimage: \"matt.jpg\"\nlinks:\n  - Blog: \"https://www.rostrum.blog/\"\n  - Twitter: \"https://twitter.com/mattdray/\"\n  - GitHub: \"https://github.com/matt-dray/\"\noutput:\n  postcards::jolla\nfavicon: favicon.gif\n---\nYou can then write your mini bio in the body text of the document. I garnished mine with emoji via Hadley Wickham’s {emo} package.\nThe {postcards} templates are ready to go out of the box but you can still tinker with the style. I decided to pull in a font, Fantasque Sans Mono by Jany Belluz3, and put a CSS chunk in the R Markdown to specify it.\n\n\n\nA preview of the ‘Jolla’ template. Tobi seems nice.\n\n\nThe content and design of my page may change at any time, but I purposefully want it to be minimal and have a clean and simple appearance. The {postcards} package is also in development, so I look forward to testing out any new features that appear in future."

Downside: your URL will be in the form username.github.io/your-postcard-repo, which isn’t particularly sleek.\nInstead you could use a free service like Netlify to deploy a site from a GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repository and set up a custom domain to point at it. I’ve had prior success with Netlify for this blog, so that’s why I’m using it here.\nA bonus of this approach is continuous deployment: pushing changes to your repo causes Netlify to rebuild and deploy your site automatically, so you don’t need to worry about it.\nTo set up my page, I signed into Netlify and I:\n\nclicked the ‘New site from Git’ button\nclicked ‘GitHub’ in section ‘1. Connect to Git provider’, because that’s where my {postcards} repo is stored\nselected my github.com/matt-dray/postcard/ repo in section ‘2. Pick a repository’ after authorising Netlify to connect to to it\nleft the ‘build command’ empty in section ‘3. Build options and deploy!’ and set the ‘publish directory’ to ‘/’ (because I want to serve index.html from the root of the repo)\nclicked ‘deploy site’\n\nNetlify takes a moment to build and serve the site after you click ‘deploy site’. It’s served automatically from a URL in the form random-name.netlify.app4 but, as mentioned, you can configure a privately-owned domain name instead.\nFor more on these steps, including screenshots, see Netlify’s step-by-step guidance on deploying static and single-page sites.\nIt’s also worth mentioning Netlify Drop: a service that lets you simply drag and drop your site’s files to deploy them, rather than needing to authorise Netlify to connect to your Git-based repo. This is quick and technically easier, but you’ll have to drag and drop each time you want to update the site."

Far better would be to introduce some kind of pathfinding via an algorithm, which would make enemies head toward the player character to engage in battle.\nIn this post I’ll start with a naive approach—simply labelling all tiles with distance from the target—then show how an approach called ‘breadth-first search’ can alleviate the problem."

For purposes of this post, I’m using an approach that I think makes it easier to grasp conceptually.\nEach dungeon will be composed of two related matrices: one matrix is the tile map, which holds the tiles the user sees (i.e. # for walls, . for floor, @ for the player character, E for enemy); the second matrix isn’t seen by the user, but holds travel-distance scores used by the enemy character to find a path to the target.\nI’ll use m throughout as the name of the matrix object holding the tile map and d as the name of the matrix object holding the distance map.\nBear in mind that the characters can only move one tile per turn in a north, south, east or west direction, which has implications for how we label tiles with their distances."

It’s just an R matrix object, but we can print it nicely so it’s easier to read.\n\n\nClick for R code\n\nManually create a basic, rectangular dungeon room:\n\n# Create room\nn_rows &lt;- 9\nn_cols &lt;- 10\nm &lt;- matrix(rep(\".\", n_rows * n_cols), n_rows, n_cols)\nm[1, ] &lt;- \"#\"  # walls\nm[, 1] &lt;- \"#\"\nm[nrow(m), ] &lt;- \"#\"\nm[, ncol(m)] &lt;- \"#\"\n\n# Add player and enemy\nm[7, 3] &lt;- \"@\"  # player\nm[3, 3] &lt;- \"E\"  # enemy\n\nFor convenience, a function that pretty-prints the matrix to the console:\n\n# Function to print the map nicely\nprint_tiles &lt;- function(x) {\n  for (i in seq(nrow(x))) {\n    cat(x[i, ], \"\\n\")\n  }\n}\n\n\nprint_tiles(m)\n\n\n\nprint_tiles(m)\n\n# # # # # # # # # # \n# . . . . . . . . # \n# .

Then the enemy can check its neighbouring tiles on each turn and select the next highest distance score until it reaches the player.\nSo, below I’ve created a distance map by assigning the player position a score of 100, then I’ve decreased the score by 1 with each additional tile away from the player (remembering that characters can only move north, south, east or west). Walls score zero, so they’re effectively ignored.\n\n\nClick for R code\n\n\nget_distance &lt;- function(m, peak_score) {\n\n  # Initiate distance matrix filled with zero\n  n_rows &lt;- nrow(m)\n  n_cols &lt;- ncol(m)\n  d &lt;- matrix(rep(0, n_cols * n_rows), n_rows, n_cols)\n\n  # Player location gets peak_score\n  player_loc &lt;- which(m == \"@\", arr.ind = TRUE)\n  m[player_loc[1], player_loc[2]] &lt;- peak_score\n\n  # Surrounding tiles get successively smaller distance scores\n  for (col_ind in seq(n_cols)) {\n    for (row_ind in seq(n_rows)) {\n      distance &lt;- abs(player_loc[1] - row_ind) + abs(player_loc[2] - col_ind)\n      value &lt;- peak_score - distance\n      if (value &lt; 0) value &lt;- 0\n      d[row_ind, col_ind] &lt;- value\n    }\n  }\n\n  # Walls aren't traversable, assign low value\n  walls &lt;- which(m == \"#\")\n  d[walls] &lt;- 0\n\n  d\n\n}\n\n\nget_distance(m, 100)\n\n\n\n\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]\n [1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0\n [2,]    0   94   95   94   93   92   91   90   89     0\n [3,]    0   95   96   95   94   93   92   91   90     0\n [4,]    0   96   97   96   95   94   93   92   91     0\n [5,]    0   97   98   97   96   95   94   93   92     0\n [6,]    0   98   99   98   97   96   95   94   93     0\n [7,]    0   99  100   99   98   97   96   95   94     0\n [8,]    0   98   99   98   97   96   95   94   93     0\n [9,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0\n\n\nSee how the player-position at [7,3] is 100 and the values then drop by 1 in all directions?\nSo the enemy would move south from its start position at [3,3] to the target position at [7,3], moving along a score gradient of 96 to 100.\nThere’s an issue with this though: obstacles. What do you think will happen if we put a dividing wall between the characters? Here’s the same room with a wall splitting the characters, plus the distance matrix using the same approach as above.\n\n\nClick for R code\n\n\nm[5, 2:8] &lt;- \"#\"\n\n\nprint_tiles(m)\n\n\n\n\n# # # # # # # # # # \n# . . . . . . . . # \n# .

The wall has been scored as zero, so the enemy looks around for the largest distance score of its remaining neighbours. They all score 96, so the enemy character just selects randomly one of west, north or east.\nUhoh: this means the enemy will be stuck in an infinite loop between the adjacent scores of 96 and 97. This isn’t very intelligent.\nHow can we account for blockages like this?"

    "text": "Here comes the flood-fill\nPerhaps a better approach is to ‘flood fill’ the distance scores. Imagine the start point is a source of water and it’s filling up the dungeon. Obviously the water will have to flow around walls and the hardest-to-reach areas will be filled last.\nA basic flood-fill approach we can implement is ‘breadth-first’, which visits tiles in a ‘frontier’ expanding from the start point. Distance scores are assigned once to frontier tiles and neighbours are consecutively added to a ‘queue’ to be checked.\nThis is slightly expensive because every traversable tile has to be assessed, but it means that multiple enemies can all use the same distance map to navigate.1\nWe don’t need to get too complicated for {r.oguelike}; it just has to work. I’ll illustrate the breadth-first approach with a pretty basic and verbose implementation.2\n\nDeep breadth-first\nNow to implement it in R. Reminder: we’ll use two matrices to represent the tile grid (seen by player) and the distance grid (just holds the distance scores).\nI’m going to use three main functions:\n\ninitiate_distance_map(), which creates a distance-map matrix of equal size to the tile map and fills all traversable spaces with zero and all non-traversable spaces with Infinity (which the character will want to avoid)\npopulate_distance_map, which flood-fills the traversable space by expanding a frontier from the start point, assigning a distance score to each neighbour that’s +1 of the score of the parent tile and adding those neighbours to the frontier queue so they can be inspected next\nmove_enemy() to move the enemy character one tile per turn towards the tile with the lowest distance score (i.e. the tile that holds the player @)\n\n\nCreate the distance-score matrix\nUsing the same obstacle map from earlier in the post, we can first initiate a complementary distance-score matrix:\n\ninitiate_distance_map &lt;- function(m) {\n\n  d &lt;- m  # copy the tile map\n  d[which(d != \"#\")] &lt;- 0  # set non-wall tiles to 0\n  d[which(d == \"#\")] &lt;- Inf  # set wall tiles to infinity\n  matrix(as.numeric(d), nrow(d), ncol(d))  # recast as numeric\n\n}\n\nNow we can adjust those distance scores. The algorithm is basically:\n\nCreate a frontier vector of tile indices (i.e. the edges of the flood-fill as it moves outward) and add the starting tile (i.e. the tile index that holds the player character)\nCreate a vector to hold tile indices that we’ve already visited\nBegin a loop where:\n\nthe first tile in the frontier queue becomes the ‘current’ tile\nthe current tile is removed to the frontier\nthe current tile is added to the visited list\nthe tile indices of the current tile’s neighbours (north, south, east and west) are identified\nif not yet visited, the neighbours are assigned distance scores that are +1 of the current tile\n\nContinue the loop until you run out of tiles in the frontier queue\n\nI’ve written a small sub-function to handle neighbour-finding:\n\nget_neighbours &lt;- function(m, current) {\n\n  n_rows &lt;- nrow(m)\n\n  c(\n    if (m[current - n_rows] != \"#\") current - n_rows,\n    if (m[current - 1] != \"#\") current - 1,\n    if (m[current + 1] != \"#\") current + 1,\n    if (m[current + n_rows] != \"#\") current + n_rows\n  )\n\n}\n\nWhich plugs into the main function for implementing the algorithm that assigns distance scores:\n\npopulate_distance_map &lt;- function(m, d) {\n\n  start &lt;- which(m == \"@\")  # start tile, i.e. player tile\n  \n  # Initiate vectors\n  frontier &lt;- start  # to be assessed\n  visited &lt;- c()  # have been assessed\n\n  while (length(frontier) &gt; 0) {\n\n    current  &lt;- frontier[1]  # set first tile of frontier as current\n    frontier &lt;- frontier[!frontier == current]  # remove current tile from frontier\n    visited  &lt;- append(visited, current)  # mark current as visited\n\n    neighbours &lt;- get_neighbours(m, current)  # get vector of neighbour indices\n    neighbours &lt;- neighbours[!neighbours %in% visited]\n\n    for (neighbour in neighbours) {\n      if (!neighbour %in% visited) {  # only assign distance to unvisited neighbours\n        d[neighbour] &lt;- d[current] + 1  # assign distance, one more than parent\n      }\n    }\n\n    frontier &lt;- append(frontier, neighbours)  # add neighbour to the frontier\n\n  }\n\n  d\n\n}\n\n\n\nMove to target\nFinally, here’s the function that lets the enemy check its neighbours for the lowest distance score and move one tile in that direction:\n\nmove_enemy &lt;- function(m, d) {\n\n  # Find tiles of interest\n  en_loc &lt;- which(m == \"E\")\n  player_loc &lt;- which(m == \"@\")\n  n_rows &lt;- nrow(m)\n\n  # Get neighbour tile indices\n  ind &lt;- c(\n    n = en_loc - 1,\n    s = en_loc + 1,\n    e = en_loc + n_rows,\n    w = en_loc - n_rows\n  )\n\n  # Get tile content for neighbours\n  tiles &lt;- c(\n    n = m[ind[\"n\"]],\n    s = m[ind[\"s\"]],\n    e = m[ind[\"e\"]],\n    w = m[ind[\"w\"]]\n  )\n\n  # Get the distance score for a tile if traversable/target\n  dist &lt;- c(\n    n = if (tiles[\"n\"] %in% c(\".\", \"@\")) d[ind[\"n\"]],\n    s = if (tiles[\"s\"] %in% c(\".\", \"@\")) d[ind[\"s\"]],\n    e = if (tiles[\"e\"] %in% c(\".\", \"@\")) d[ind[\"e\"]],\n    w = if (tiles[\"w\"] %in% c(\".\", \"@\")) d[ind[\"w\"]]\n  )\n\n  # Sample a direction if there's ties, move there\n  direction &lt;- sample(names(dist[dist == min(dist)]), 1)\n  en_loc_new &lt;- ind[names(ind) == direction]\n  m[en_loc] &lt;- \".\"  # replace old location with floor tile\n  m[en_loc_new] &lt;- \"E\"  # place enemy in new location\n\n  m\n\n}\n\n\n\nPut it all together\nNow to apply the functions to our dungeon room, with its minor obstacle.

You can see the start tile at [7,3] scores zero and emanates out to the right, around the obstacle, before wrapping back to the top-left and toward the enemy at position [3,3].\nThe enemy needs only to move to the neighbouring tile with the lowest distance score. So from 16 to 15 on either [4,3] or [3,4], then to 14, to 13, etc.\nSee how this time the character won’t get stuck trying to move south? The distance scores decrease from left to right before curving round the wall in the direction of the player’s tile.\nFor fun, we can print to the console an animation of the movement, which I’ve captured in gif form.\n\n\nClick for R code\n\n\nrepeat {\n  cat(\"\\014\")  # clear console\n  m &lt;- move_enemy(m, d)  # move enemy\n  print_tiles(m)  # print to console\n  Sys.sleep(0.5)  # wait\n  if (!any(m == \"@\")) break  # stop if player captured\n}\n\n\n\nYou can see the enemy go round the wall and reach the player using a pretty efficient path.\nAnd in a more dungeonlike room:"

    "text": "Double trouble\nSometimes I write code in an RStudio Project and then go and do something else. My memory is terrible, so later I might open a second instance of the same project and wonder what happened to that code I’d written before.\nIs there a way to stop this from happening? Maybe there’s a setting in RStudio or something? Maybe I should just Google it?\nNah, instead I hacked together a little function that can be run on startup to warn me—via both text and audio—if I have multiple RStudio sessions open with the same name. It’s called check_rproj_dupes().\nNote that the function checks which OS you’re using with .Platform$OS.type, with the hope that one day I (or you) will write some corresponding code that will work on Windows. I don’t use Windows, so I can’t test anything.\nThe code has a few steps:\n\nPass the ps (process status) command with flag -e (show all running processes) to the shell via the system() function, which is captured in a vector when intern = TRUE\nUse grepl() to isolate the strings that contain the ‘.RProj’ RStudio Project extension\nExtract the full paths to the .RProj files\nExtract the basenames from the paths (i.e. just the filename for the .RProj)\nCompare the basenames to see which are duplicated\nDisplay any matches in a warning message and, if speak = TRUE, read aloud a warning message that’s passed to the say function via system()\n\nYeah, this could be simplified, but I’m no code golfer. I just want it to work and for it to be pretty obvious what it’s doing.\nHere it is (or see it in a GitHub Gist, where you can write your suggestions for how to improve it):\n\ncheck_rproj_dupes &lt;- function(speak = FALSE) {\n\n  os &lt;- .Platform$OS.type\n\n  if (os == \"unix\") {\n\n    ps_out &lt;- system(\"ps -e\", intern = TRUE)\n    ps_rproj &lt;- ps_out[grepl(\".Rproj\", ps_out)]\n    ps_split &lt;- strsplit(ps_rproj, \"\\\\s\")\n    rproj_paths &lt;- lapply(ps_split, function(x) x[grepl(\".Rproj$\", x)])\n    rproj_basenames &lt;- lapply(rproj_paths, basename)\n    rproj_dupes &lt;- sort(unlist(rproj_basenames[duplicated(rproj_basenames)]))\n\n  }\n\n  if (os == \"windows\") {\n    stop(\"Sorry, check_rproj_dupes() doesn't work on Windows yet :-(\")\n  }\n\n  if (length(rproj_dupes) &gt; 0) {\n\n    if (speak & os == \"unix\") {\n\n      dupes_string &lt;- paste(rproj_dupes, collapse = \", \")\n      dupes_string_say &lt;- gsub(\"\\\\.Rproj\", \" dot ar proj \", dupes_string)\n\n      message &lt;- paste(\n        \"say ha, you fool, you have more than one open RStudio Project with\",\n        ifelse(length(rproj_dupes) == 1, \"this name:\", \"these names:\"),\n        dupes_string_say\n      )\n\n      system(message)\n\n    }\n\n    warning(\n      \"You've got open RStudio Projects with the same name:\\n\",\n      paste(\"-\", rproj_dupes, collapse = \"\\n\"), \"\\n\",\n      call. = FALSE\n    )\n\n  }\n\n}\n\ncheck_rproj_dupes()\nrm(check_rproj_dupes)\n\nHow would you actually use this though?\nYou can add it to your ‘hidden’ .Rprofile file, which is a place that you can store code that runs whenever RStudio is started.1 Perhaps the easiest way to open it is with usethis::edit_r_profile(). Then you can paste in all the code from the block above.2\nOn startup, the code will run and if there’s no problem, then you’ll see no message. No news is good news.\nBut let’s say I had opened sandbox.Rproj earlier and was now opening the file again. In this second RStudio instance, the usual R startup message will print, followed by a warning:\nWarning message:\nYou've got open RStudio Projects with the same name:\n- sandbox.Rproj \nIf speak = TRUE then you’ll also hear this:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo hopefully now I will be less confused when trying to manage my RStudio sessions. At worst I’ll be shocked to hear the creepy computer voice tell me I’m a fool."

Watch the video on YouTube, or take a look at the slides.\nTo summarise greatly: R code should be speakable so that we can teach, learn and communicate with minimal friction.\n‘Speakable’ means I should be able to read an R expression to you as an English sentence (rather than reading out individual characters) and we should be able to understand each other.\nBut this is all easier said than… said.\nIdeally we’d have an agreed dictionary that maps each R token to an equivalent English phrase. But there will always be variation between users and across communities; between beginners and aficionados; and given differences in spoken language.\nThen there’s context. We might agree that the operator %&gt;% is called a ‘pipe’, but you might say the word ‘then’ when reading an expression. So data %&gt;% print() might be spoken as ‘data then print’.\nThe order of parsing may also differ between people. Something as simple as x &lt;- 1 could be ‘x gets 1’, ‘assign the value 1 to the variable named x’, or something else entirely. Now imagine that on the scale of an entire script.\nI don’t think we can completely ‘solve’ any of this, but we could probably develop the conversation with the help of a tool accessible from R itself."

    "text": "Hello {r2eng}\nThis is where the {r2eng} package comes in. The goal is to take an R expression and translate it to an equivalent speakable, English sentence, from within R itself.\nThe initial focus has been to:\n\nconcentrate on translating to English (I’m biased)\nmap the most common R operators (e.g. assignment, maths, brackets)\nuse commonly-used (but currently opinionated1) English translations for R operators (‘gets’ for &lt;-)\nwork on a simple one-to-one, left-to-right mapping of R to English\nkeep the API simple, so you just supply an expression and get a result\nsimply begin an approach to address what was raised in Amelia’s presentation\n\nObviously the package is not finished, let alone perfect, and it requires more theoretical and practical considerations to make it truly useful. Clearly I don’t have all the answers and I’m certainly not an arbiter of language, but I think the purpose is defined and it certainly works for simple cases.\nAt worst, I hope the package will encourage discussion. There’s been some interest on Twitter and on the RStudio Community site, but do consider contributing thoughts and ideas to the {r2eng} GitHub repo.\nIn this vein, it’s important to highlight Chung-hong Chan’s valuable contributions to the package. Check out his website and find him on Twitter. Chung-hong was responsible for updating {r2eng} to handle non-standard evaluation in the translate() function and for replacing my original simple R-to-English lookup with a proper parsing method for interpreting R expressions.\n\nInstallation\nYou can install the package from GitHub using the {remotes} package. The package is in development version 0.0.0.9005 at the time of writing and this post discusses functionality for that version. Things may change.\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not already installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/r2eng\")\n\n\n\nHow it works\n\nRecognising tokens\nThe secret sauce of the package is that it recognises the ‘tokens’ that make up an R expression. So the assignment operator, &lt;-, is recognised as a single token rather than the less-than (&lt;) and hyphen (-) characters typed sequentially.\nThis power is brought to {r2eng} thanks to {lintr}, a package by Jim Hester that assesses your code for possible errors and style improvements.\nAn important part of this process is parsing R expressions and recognising tokens using the lintr::get_source_expressions() function. For example, that &lt;- operator is recognised as the special token LEFT_ASSIGN under the hood.\nThis is some deep R magic. You can see a special grammar file file in the R source code that carries these mappings.2\nPut simply, {r2eng} hijacks this process, adds a step that maps each token to English terms, then recombines the text into a sentence.\n\n\nSpeech\nBy default, {r2eng} will translate an R expression and then your computer will speak it out loud.\nThis is relatively straightforward on a Mac: the resulting English text is handed to your machine with a system() call and is vocalised by the built-in VoiceOver text-to-speech converter. This functionality is not built into Windows by default, so the system() call fails silently.\nOf course, this assumes that VoiceOver will do a good job of parsing the English expression from {r2eng}, but that isn’t guaranteed because of issues like localised pronunciation and uncommon words. I’ve written before about how text-to-speech isn’t necessarily that good at recognising R package names, for example.\nIn theory, and assuming that the translation gets good, {r2eng} could be used as a simple accessibility tool because it can interpret R-specific tokens in a way that VoiceOver cannot.\n\n\n\nUsing {r2eng}\nYou can find further examples in the package README, but I’ll explain here the main functionality.\nFirst I’ll attach the package after having installed it.\n\nlibrary(r2eng)\n\n\nThe translate() function\nThere are two main functions in {r2eng}: translate() and translate_string(). They convert from a bare or quoted R expression, respectively, to English.\ntranslate() takes advantage of non-standard evaluation: you pass bare (i.e. unquoted) R code to the expression argument and a few things happen.\n\ntranslate(data &lt;- 1 + 1)\n\nOriginal expression: data &lt;- 1 + 1\nEnglish expression: data gets 1 plus 1 \n\n\nFirst, it prints both the original R expression and the corresponding English translation. Second, and only if you are using macOS, the English string is passed to a system command that vocalises the string.\nHere’s a more complex example using some {dplyr} functions. Note that we don’t need to attach {dplyr} to be able to translate.\n\ntranslate(\n  data %&gt;% select(x, y) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(y == \"example\"),\n  function_call_end = \"\"\n)\n\nOriginal expression: data %&gt;% select(x, y) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(y == \"example\")\nEnglish expression: data then select open paren x , y close paren then dplyr double-colon filter open paren y double equals string \"example\" close paren\n\n\nNote the function_call_end argument in this example. The default is \"of \", which would would have made the translation data then select of open paren x y close paren, etc. Feedback suggested that this was how some users spoke the English translation out loud, so the functionality has been included for now.\nWhile translate() takes a bare expression, translate_string() takes a string.\n\nlibrary(magrittr)  # attach for pipes\n\"data&lt;-1+1\" %&gt;%\n  translate_string(speak = FALSE)\n\nOriginal expression: data &lt;- 1 + 1\nEnglish expression: data gets 1 plus 1 \n\n\nWe get the same sort of output as the translate() example, but this time I set the speak argument to FALSE to stop the English text from being ‘spoken’ by my computer and I also eliminated spaces from the input to demonstrate that they’re ignored.\n\n\nr2eng objects\nOf course, you can assign a translation to an object.\n\nmy_translation &lt;- \n  translate(data &lt;- 1 + 1, speak = FALSE)\n\nThe object is a special r2eng S3 class of object, which is also a list.\n\nclass(my_translation)\n\n[1] \"list\"  \"r2eng\"\n\n\nYou can apply some methods to such an object: print(), speak() and evaluate().\nPrint the object to see that custom console output again:\n\nprint(my_translation)\n\nOriginal expression: data &lt;- 1 + 1\nEnglish expression: data gets 1 plus 1 \n\n\nRe-call the system command that ‘speaks’ the R expression out loud (again, only on macOS).\n\nspeak(my_translation)\n\nAnd you can actually evaluate the R expression you supplied to translate() in the first place. So the expression we supplied, data &lt;- 1 + 1, is evaluated so that calling data gives us the result of 1 + 1.\n\nevaluate(my_translation)\ndata\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\nr2eng-class list elements\nYou can also access the R expression, the English translation and the mapping between them as elements of your r2eng list object.\nHere’s the R expression again:\n\nmy_translation$r_expression\n\n[1] \"data &lt;- 1 + 1\"\n\n\nAnd the translated output:\n\nmy_translation$eng_expression\n\n[1] \" data gets 1 plus 1 \"\n\n\nAnd a data.frame object that contains the mapping.\n\nmap &lt;- my_translation$translation_map\nmap[map$text != \"\", ]  # filter out text spaces\n\n        token text  eng\n1      SYMBOL data data\n2 LEFT_ASSIGN   &lt;- gets\n4   NUM_CONST    1    1\n6         '+'    + plus\n7   NUM_CONST    1    1\n\n\nThis element is a good summary of what {r2eng} is doing under the hood: it breaks the R expression into recognised tokens and maps words to them where it knows what the corresponding English for that token should be. So &lt;- is recognised as the token LEFT_ASSIGN, which is mapped internally to the English text gets.\n\n\n\nBonus material\n\nRStudio Addin\nThe print() and speak() functions can be accessed via an RStudio addin that’s installed with the package (you may need to restart RStudio after installation). To use them, highlight an R expression in your script and select from the RStudio addins menu:\n\n‘Speak R Expression In English’ to vocalise the expression through your computer’s speakers (macOS only)\n‘Print R Expression In English’ to output an English translation to the console\n\nThese can be mapped to keyboard shortcuts so you can highlight and translate quickly without specifically calling translate() and print() or speak().\n\n\nBinder demo\nMaybe you don’t want to install the package. That’s fine. Instead, you can try out the package by opening this Binder instance of RStudio with {r2eng} and the tidyverse pre-installed. Click this badge to launch it:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe downside is that you can’t use the speak method. Make sure to set the argument speak = FALSE in translate() or translate_string(), or you’ll get a warning message when you run your code.\nYou can find the source for this at the try-r2eng GitHub repo and you can read one of my posts on how to set up Binder using Karthik Ram’s {holepunch} package."

Let’s say we have a template that renders a report about Star Wars characters1: starwars-template.Rmd. We might use a name param to declare a character name:\n---\ntitle: Star Wars\nauthor: Matt Dray\ndate: 2020-03-12\nparams:\n  name: \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\"\n---\nNow \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" will be supplied wherever you reference params$name in the code of your document.\nMaybe you’re filtering the dplyr::starwars data set to get eye color, so filter(starwars, name == params$name) %&gt;% pull(eye_color) will return blue-gray when rendered.\nChange the param to name: Chewbacca and every instance of params$name will take the new value on render.

In other words, a continuous integration platform baked right into GitHub.\nBefore you start, I recommend checking out Jim Hester’s talk from rstudio::conf 2020 and reading the GitHub Actions with R book.\nGitHub Actions can be really helpful for developing R packages.1 For example, you can trigger actions with a push or pull request (PR) that:\n\nrun an R CMD build check of your package on multiple platforms\nrun your {testthat} unit tests\ncheck test coverage with {covr} and Codecov\nrebuild your {pkgdown} website\n\nChecking the build and coverage are standard practices for package development. They help ensure that your package works and is stable. GitHub Actions provides the icing on the cake by doing these things automatically.\nThese are all important for users of your package too. Build and coverage results show the robustness of the code and a website makes your documentation much easier to access.\nI wrote this post to remind me how to do it."

The information is interpreted and the actions are run remotely given the specified trigger.\nYou can learn more about the content of these YAML files from the GitHub actions with R book.\nYou could set these up manually, but actually you can shortcut the process with the {usethis} package and some pre-written examples."

    "section": "{usethis} and r-lib",
    "text": "{usethis} and r-lib\n{usethis} helps to shortcut the tedious setup steps of R packages and projects. It also includes functions to add GitHub Actions to your R package for you.\nIn particular, usethis::use_github_action() will add a YAML file to .github/workflows/ where GitHub Actions will find it; you just supply the name of a pre-written action.\nWhere do these pre-written actions come from? Well, the kind folks at r-lib have made a repo of R-focused examples that you can use.\n\nExample: {r2eng} package\nI recently used this method to set up GitHub Actions for the in-development {r2eng} package.\n{r2eng} has three actions in the workflow folder:\n\nR-CMD-check.yaml (see the YAML file) to run a build check\ntest-coverage.yaml (YAML) to assess how much of the code is protected by testing\npkgdown.yaml (YAML) to build the package’s website with {pkgdown}\n\nThis is a typical, minimal set of actions that suit me when developing R packages. Let’s talk them through.\n\n1. Build check\nAn R CMD check2 runs a bunch of tests on your package (including your own unit tests) and returns errors, notes and warnings. You’re aiming for a passing build to prove the package is up to scratch.\n{usethis} has three actions-related functions specifically for setting up the build check. The standard one will run the R CMD check on macOS, Linux and Windows to make sure it passes across all these platforms.3\nRun this line to add the R-CMD-check.yaml action to the .github/workflows/ folder:\n\nusethis::use_github_action_check_standard()\n\nNote that this function will create .github/workflows/ if it doesn’t already exist.\nFolllowing a push or PR, GitHub Actions will now automatically set up and run a build check on each OS to make sure the package meets the requirements.\n\n\n2. Test coverage\nThe R CMD check runs your unit tests, but it doesn’t calculate how much of your code is actually covered by testing. Ideally you want this to be 100%, but also bear in mind that the metric doesn’t take account of the volume or quality of tests.\nI use another r-lib package, {covr}, to interactively check how much of my code is tested. (In particular, the covr::report() function provides an interactive HTML report showing the total percentage and a line-by-line breakdown of where tests are missing.)\nYou can set up the free services Codecov or Coveralls to make your results public. You’ll need to have signed up for these services and granted their access to the repo you want to report on.\n{usethis} makes it easy to set up these services for your repo: it adds the relevant YAML files, a line to the ‘Suggests’ section of your DESCRIPTION, and a badge to your README.\n\nusethis::use_coverage(\"codecov\")\n\nYou can see an example in action on the Codecov page for {r2eng}, which shows the percentage of coverage, a breakdown of the lines ‘hit’ and ‘missed’, and the commits that led to checks.\nOf course, you can automate this. Run this line to add the test-coverage.yaml action to the .github/workflows/ folder\n\nusethis::use_github_action(\"test-coverage\")\n\nThe ‘test-coverage’ GitHub Action will recheck coverage when you next push to the repo, with the results being updated on your coverage service of choice.\n\n\n3. Build {pkgdown} site\n{pkgdown}, also from r-lib, can automatically and painlessly generate a simple website from your package’s documentation, which you are free to customise. You can serve the site on the web via GitHub Pages so users can access the docs easily online.\nFor example, here’s the {pkgdown} website for the {r2eng} package, which uses default settings at time of writing. You can see that the README has become the home page and there are ‘Reference’ and ‘Changelog’ tabs that autopoulate with the function documentation and NEWS file. Additional tabs are added here depending on the contents of your repo; for example, vignettes are added to an ‘Articles’ tab if they exist.\nThe GitHub Actions with R book has a section on {pkgdown}. In short, the steps are:\n\nSet-up an empty ‘gh-pages’ branch in your repo (the book has some code to do this from the command line)4\nBack in the main branch, run the {usethis} usethis::use_pkgdown() to activate {pkgdown} for your package repo\nRun usethis::use_github_action(\"pkgdown\") to add the YAML file that tells GitHub Actions to build the website on push\nPush to your repo and GitHub Actions will generate the website files in the gh-pages branch\nFrom your repo settings, set GitHub Pages to serve from the root of the gh-pages branch\nWait a few minutes and navigate to your site (in the form ‘username.github.io/reponame’)\n\nGitHub Actions will now rebuild the site automatically every time you make changes and push them."

Ticks! Ticks!\n\n\nYou can also generate Markdown badges5 for your README that display the results of these actions and automatically update when they’re re-run. These are great for an at-a-glance understanding of a package’s development state. {usethis} adds these to your README automatically, but it’s useful to know that you can get these badges from GitHub itself.\n\n\n\nMore easily obtained than having to defeat a Pokémon gym leader.\n\n\nFor example, you can see badges in the {r2eng} README, like this one showing the percentage of test coverage:\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking them takes you to the relevant codecov.io page for the full breakdown of results."

There’s also an ‘awesome list’ of more general-purpose actions to explore.\nIt’s important to note that there are several other platforms for continuous integration, like Travis CI and Appveyor (see Roger Peng’s book for an overview), but this requires you to setup multiple accounts and configuration files. At time of writing, GitHub Actions has the benefit of testing across all the major operating systems and is easier to set up (learn more in Jim Hester’s talk).\nAnyway, good luck in putting a GitHub Action in action on GitHub."

    "section": "Process",
    "text": "Process\n\nAttach packages\nI’ve been using Matt Dowle and Arun Srinivasan’s lightning-fast {data.table} package recently and wanted to use it here to handle millions of UK postcodes. I’ve prioritised for readability in this post rather than efficiency, but let me know how to improve things.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages({\n  library(data.table)  # a better data.frame\n  library(stringr)     # simple string handling\n  library(tictoc)      # timing\n})\n\nI’m using Sergei Izrailev’s {tictoc} package to time the processes throughout.\n\n\nGet the data\nThe latest postcode data (February 2020) is available on the Open Geography Portal by the Office for National Statistics. From there you can download a zipped folder that contains the file we want, NSPL_FEB_2020_UK.csv.\n\n Note\nI re-rendered this post in July 2023 and the link to the February 2020 postcode file no longer works. Instead, we’ll use the latest at time of writing: February 2023.\n\n\nFirst, you can download the .zip to a temporary location on your machine. The file is pretty large (about 180 MB), so I’m increasing the timeout value for download.file() so that the download has time to complete. You might want to consider downloading the file to your local computer and reading it from there.\n\n# URL to postcode zip file\nzip_url &lt;- paste0(\n  \"https://www.arcgis.com/\",\n  \"sharing/rest/content/items/\",\n  \"c7debafcef564e7a9dfb8ca881be4253/data\"\n)\n\n# Setup a temporary folder to download into\ntmp &lt;- tempdir()\nzip_path &lt;- file.path(tmp, \"postcodes.zip\")\n\n# Download the zip file to the tempporary location\noptions(timeout = max(1000, getOption(\"timeout\")))\ndownload.file(zip_url, zip_path)\n\nYou can then unzip() the CSV file inside {data.table}’s fread() for a rapid read.\n\ntic(\"CSV read complete\")\npcodes_dt &lt;- fread(unzip(zip_path, files = \"Data/NSPL21_FEB_2023_UK.csv\"))\ntoc()\n\nCSV read complete: 10.482 sec elapsed\n\nunlink(tmp)  # remove temp location\n\nAnd we can check the dimensions of this object.\n\n# Rows and columns in the data set\ndim(pcodes_dt)\n\n[1] 2687274      41\n\n\nSo there’s more than 2.5 million rows. Some postcodes have, however, been terminated over time. We’ll need to filter for the postcodes that are still active (thanks to Robert Kaleta for pointing this out).\nWe can also simplify to just the postcode column that we want using {data.table}‘s .() notation. Data in the pcds column has the consistent form of letter, letter, digit, space, digit, letter, letter (e.g. ’AB12 3CD’), which makes them relatively easy to deal with.\n\n# Filter for empty date of termination (doterm)\n# Retain only the postcode column\npcodes_dt &lt;- pcodes_dt[is.na(doterm), .(pcds)]\n\nhead(pcodes_dt)\n\n       pcds\n1: AB10 1AB\n2: AB10 1AF\n3: AB10 1AG\n4: AB10 1AH\n5: AB10 1AL\n6: AB10 1AN\n\nnrow(pcodes_dt)\n\n[1] 1793019\n\n\nYou can see that this removes a large number of terminated postcodes.\n\n\nExtract\nNow to extract the numbers and letters so that ‘AB12 3CD’ is broken into A, B, 12, 3, C and D, for example. Note that we want to extract multi-digit numbers if they exist within each half (the ‘outward’ and ‘inward’ parts) of the postcode, so 12 rather than 1 and 2, and 12 and 3 rather than 123.\nThe walrus operator (:=) is used here as a function to create new columns and assign names to them. I’ve chose to use {stringr}’s str_extract_all() function to match the strings we want. The regular expression contains values in the curly braces to indicate the desired character lengths to be matched.\nThis will produce two list-columns: one with the letters extracted into it and one with the numbers.\n\n# Extract letters into one list column and numbers into another\npcodes_dt[, `:=`(letter = str_extract_all(pcds, \"[:alpha:]{1}\"),\n                 number = str_extract_all(pcds, \"[:digit:]{1,2}\"))]\n\npcodes_dt\n\n             pcds  letter number\n      1: AB10 1AB A,B,A,B   10,1\n      2: AB10 1AF A,B,A,F   10,1\n      3: AB10 1AG A,B,A,G   10,1\n      4: AB10 1AH A,B,A,H   10,1\n      5: AB10 1AL A,B,A,L   10,1\n     ---                        \n1793015:  ZE3 9JU Z,E,J,U    3,9\n1793016:  ZE3 9JW Z,E,J,W    3,9\n1793017:  ZE3 9JX Z,E,J,X    3,9\n1793018:  ZE3 9JY Z,E,J,Y    3,9\n1793019:  ZE3 9JZ Z,E,J,Z    3,9\n\n\nRemember that {data.table} edits in place, so the pcodes_dt object will be updated and without the need to overwrite it (i.e. no need to do something like pcodes_dt &lt;- pcodes_dt[&lt;whatever&gt;]).\n\n\nNumbers and letters\nNow to work with the number list-column. The values are currently character-class because they were extracted from the postcode strings; they need to be made numeric before they can be summed. lapply() is used here to pass the function as.numeric() to achieve this.\n\ntic(\"Make numbers numeric class\")\npcodes_dt[, number := lapply(number, as.numeric)]\ntoc()\n\nMake numbers numeric class: 4.502 sec elapsed\n\n\nAnd now to work with the letter list column. The custom function in lapply() first turns the letters into the factor class, where the full set of possible levels is provided by the LETTERS vector, and then uses as.numeric() to convert each factor level to its corresponding numeric value.\nThis works on the principle that as.numeric(factor(c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"))) becomes c(1, 2, 3). The first factor level, A gets converted to 1, B to 2 and so on.\n\ntic(\"Convert letters to numbers, make numeric class\")\npcodes_dt[, letter_number := lapply(\n  letter, function(x) as.numeric(factor(x, levels = LETTERS)))]\ntoc()\n\nConvert letters to numbers, make numeric class: 11.431 sec elapsed\n\n\n\n\nScores\nNow to separately sum the number and letter values in each row of the list-columns and add them together for the final score.\n\n# Generate summation columns for letters and numbers separately\npcodes_dt[, `:=`(number_sum = lapply(number, sum),\n                 letter_sum = lapply(letter_number, sum))]\n\n# Make the sum columns numeric- rather than list-class\npcodes_dt$number_sum &lt;- as.numeric(pcodes_dt$number_sum)\npcodes_dt$letter_sum &lt;- as.numeric(pcodes_dt$letter_sum)\n\n# Sum the number and letter values\npcodes_dt[, score := number_sum + letter_sum]\n\n# The first few scores\nhead(pcodes_dt[, .(pcds, number_sum, letter_sum, score)])\n\n       pcds number_sum letter_sum score\n1: AB10 1AB         11          6    17\n2: AB10 1AF         11         10    21\n3: AB10 1AG         11         11    22\n4: AB10 1AH         11         12    23\n5: AB10 1AL         11         16    27\n6: AB10 1AN         11         18    29\n\n\nSo you can see, for example, that AB10 1AB has a number sum of 11 (10 + 1) and a letter sum of 6 (a couple of As and Bs, so 1 + 2 + 1 + 2), totalling 17."

    "text": "A pizza by any other name\nWelcome to the pizzeria. It’s called ‘La PizzRia’ because our owner likes to code and is really lazy at puns.\n\nToppings as vectors\nOur specialty (and only!) pizza is pizza alla napoletana, which is topped with mozzarella, tomatoes and anchovies.\n\n# Create a character-vector object\nnapoletana &lt;- c(\"mozzarella\", \"tomato\", \"anchovy\")\n\nThe English version of the menu calls it ‘Neapolitan’ pizza, but it’s the same thing.\n\nneapolitan &lt;- napoletana       # copy the object\nall(neapolitan == napoletana)  # they're equal\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nWe store our unique sets of pizza toppings in a special recipe book. If you look up ‘napoletana’ and ‘Neapolitan’ in the book’s index, you’ll see they point to the same recipe.\n\n# The {lobstr} package helps understand object structure\nlibrary(lobstr)  # after install.packages(\"lobstr\")\n\n# Get the specific object 'address' in your computer's memory\n# Both names point to the same object\nobj_addr(napoletana)  # original object\n\n[1] \"0x129af4728\"\n\nobj_addr(neapolitan)  # the copy\n\n[1] \"0x129af4728\"\n\n\nBasically, the pizzaiolos don’t care: different names, same pizza. The recipe codes are the same.\n\n Advanced R, p19\n“The object, or value, doesn’t have a name; it’s actually the name that has a value.”\n\n\n\n\nCopying a recipe, modifying it\nWe recently added pizza pugliese to the menu. We copied our napoletana in the recipe book and then modified it to have onions instead of anchovies.\n\npugliese &lt;- napoletana       # copy the object\nall(pugliese == napoletana)  # the objects are the same\n\n[1] TRUE\n\npugliese[[3]] &lt;- \"onion\"  # modify the third element\npugliese == napoletana    # they're no longer the same\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nWhen we look up these names in the index of our recipe book, we see that they point to different places, despite having copied the napoletana to get the pugliese.\n\n# Now the names point to different objects\n# We modified the copy, so it becomes a new object in memory\nobj_addr(napoletana)  # original object\n\n[1] \"0x129af4728\"\n\nobj_addr(pugliese)    # the modified copy\n\n[1] \"0x12b32ec68\"\n\n\n\n Advanced R, p22\n“This behaviour is called copy-on-modify.”\n\n\nSo, here’s our full pizza lineup in Italian and English.\n\napulian &lt;- pugliese  # specify English name for the pugliese\n\n# A comparison of the pizza object structures\nknitr::kable(\n  tibble::tribble(\n    ~Language, ~Name, ~`Toppings`, ~`Recipe code`, \n    \"ITA\", \"Pizza alla napoletana\", napoletana, obj_addr(napoletana),\n    \"ENG\", \"Neapolitan pizza\", neapolitan, obj_addr(neapolitan),\n    \"ITA\", \"Pizza pugliese\", pugliese, obj_addr(pugliese),\n    \"ENG\", \"Apulian pizza\", apulian, obj_addr(apulian)\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\nName\nToppings\nRecipe code\n\n\n\n\nITA\nPizza alla napoletana\nmozzarella, tomato , anchovy\n0x129af4728\n\n\nENG\nNeapolitan pizza\nmozzarella, tomato , anchovy\n0x129af4728\n\n\nITA\nPizza pugliese\nmozzarella, tomato , onion\n0x12b32ec68\n\n\nENG\nApulian pizza\nmozzarella, tomato , onion\n0x12b32ec68\n\n\n\n\n\nPizza alla napoletana and its copy, Neapolitan pizza, point to the same recipe code.\nPizza pugliese was a copy of pizza alla napoletana, but it now points to a different recipe code. Why? An element was changed, anchovies to onions, so a new recipe code was required.\nFinally, Apulian pizza is a copy of the pizza pugliese recipe, so they both point to the same unique topping set.\n\n\nToppings as lists\nOur knowledge management system was, however, a bit inefficient: the mozzarella and tomato toppings existed twice in our recipe book; once for each pizza.\nSo we decided to update our recipe system to store each topping separately, each with its own special reference code too.\nAgain, we wrote down the pizza napoletana toppings, copied them, then switched the anchovies for onions. Like in our old system, the two pizzas differ in their third element.\n\n# Toppings now as list elements\nnapoletana &lt;- list(\"mozzarella\", \"tomato\", \"anchovy\")\npugliese &lt;- napoletana          # make a copy\nidentical(pugliese, napoletana) # they're the same\n\n[1] TRUE\n\npugliese[[3]] &lt;- \"onion\"        # make a change\nidentical(pugliese, napoletana) # now they're different\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nSo in the new system, each topping has its own unique ingredient code.

This could become much more efficient when storing more than the two pizzas we have on La PizzRia’s menu.3\n\n\nCustomer orders as data frames\nHow do we manage orders? Wait-staff write down each order in a column, with a row for each topping.\n\n Advanced R, p26\n“Data frames are lists of vectors.”\n\n\nLet’s say a couple orders a pizza napoletana and a pizza pugliese.\n\n# Create a data.frame, which is a list of vectors\n# Column behaviour is vector behaviour\norder &lt;- data.frame(\n  napoletana = c(\"mozzarella\", \"tomato\", \"anchovy\"),\n  pugliese = c(\"mozzarella\", \"tomato\", \"onion\")\n)\n\norder\n\n  napoletana   pugliese\n1 mozzarella mozzarella\n2     tomato     tomato\n3    anchovy      onion\n\n\nAs we know, these pizzas both have mozzarella and tomatoes, but the third topping is different.\nBut wait: the customer who ordered the napoletana is hungry for more anchovies!\n\norder_update &lt;- order  # copy the data.frame object\norder_update[3, 1] &lt;- \"anchovy (extra)\"  # modify the new object\norder_update\n\n       napoletana   pugliese\n1      mozzarella mozzarella\n2          tomato     tomato\n3 anchovy (extra)      onion\n\n\nWe use a code reference system for our orders too and it works just like our old recipe system.\nSince one of the pizza orders was changed, our reference code for the entire order was changed too.\nThe napoletana was modified after it was copied, so the recipe code for that pizza was updated. The pugliese didn’t change, so its code was maintained.\n\n# Compare the data.frame structures\n# Modified column gets new code, object gets new code\n# Second column unchanged, code stays the same\nref(order, order_update)\n\n█ [1:0x12abc7548] &lt;df[,2]&gt; \n├─napoletana = [2:0x12c1de9f8] &lt;chr&gt; \n└─pugliese = [3:0x12c1de908] &lt;chr&gt; \n \n█ [4:0x129ba3408] &lt;df[,2]&gt; \n├─napoletana = [5:0x129d1c948] &lt;chr&gt; \n└─pugliese = [3:0x12c1de908] \n\n\n\n Advanced R, p26\n“If you modify a column, only that column needs to be modified.”\n\n\nThe mozzarella is especially bountiful this year; the waiter suggests both patrons take advantage.\nThey strongly agree. The order is copied once more and the waiter modifies the ‘cheese row’ for both pizzas.\n\norder_final &lt;- order_update  # copy the object\norder_final[1, 1:2] &lt;- \"mozzarella (extra)\"  # modify row one of both columns\norder_final\n\n          napoletana           pugliese\n1 mozzarella (extra) mozzarella (extra)\n2             tomato             tomato\n3    anchovy (extra)              onion\n\n\nAltering the cheese row means both pizza columns are copied and given new codes.

Why are wait staff writing down pizza orders in a dataframe, etc?\nI’ve also deceived you with some ‘polite fiction’, in Hadley’s words. In a numeric vector, the name points to the values.

    "text": "Dependensheeesh\nNow that {itdepends} has extracted all the function calls from each of the packages, we can take a look at their frequencies.\n\nExample\nHere’s the top 10 most-used functions from the first package alphabetically: {academictwitteR}.\n\nex_pkg &lt;- \"academictwitteR\"\n\ndep_list[[ex_pkg]] |&gt; \n  count(pkg, fun, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  slice(1:5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  pkg   fun       n\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 base  &lt;-      228\n2 base  {       197\n3 base  if      109\n4 base  $        90\n5 base  !        42\nIt’s not particularly exciting to know that the top 5 are made up of base R functions like the assignment arrow (&lt;-), the dollar-sign ($) data accessor2 and the square bracket ([). We also don’t really care about the package’s internal functions. Let’s filter out these packages and re-count\n\nbase_pkgs &lt;- sessionInfo()$basePkgs\n\ndep_list[[ex_pkg]] |&gt;\n  filter(!pkg %in% c(base_pkgs, ex_pkg)) |&gt; \n  count(pkg, fun, sort = TRUE) |&gt; \n  slice(1:10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   pkg       fun                n\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 lifecycle deprecate_soft    16\n 2 magrittr  %&gt;%               14\n 3 dplyr     bind_rows          8\n 4 dplyr     left_join          5\n 5 dplyr     select_if          5\n 6 httr      status_code        4\n 7 jsonlite  read_json          4\n 8 purrr     map_dfr            4\n 9 tibble    tibble             4\n10 dplyr     distinct           3\nAha. We can see immediately that the authors have made use of tidyverse to write their package, since you can see {dplyr}, {tibble}, etc, in there. This makes the use of {lubridate} relatively unsurprising.\nHere’s the {lubridate} functions used by this package.\n\ndep_list[[ex_pkg]] |&gt;\n  filter(pkg == \"lubridate\") |&gt; \n  count(pkg, fun, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  pkg       fun             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 lubridate as_datetime     1\n2 lubridate seconds         1\n3 lubridate with_tz         1\n4 lubridate ymd_hms         1\nSo this package uses four {lubridate} functions for conversion and formatting of datetimes.\n\n\nAll packages\nNow let’s take a look at the function calls across all the packages that import {lubridate}. I’m first going to convert the list of results to a dataframe.\n\ndep_df &lt;- do.call(rbind, dep_list)\n\n\nFunction use by package\nThis is a count of the number of uses of each {lubridate} function by each of the the focus packages (i.e. the packages we installed).\n\npkg_fn_count &lt;- dep_df |&gt;\n  filter(pkg == \"lubridate\") |&gt;\n  count(focus, fun, sort = TRUE)\n\npkg_fn_count |&gt; slice(1:5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  focus        fun         n\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1 PriceIndices month    1096\n2 PriceIndices year      678\n3 tidyndr      as_date    53\n4 RClimacell   with_tz    52\n5 RobinHood    ymd_hms    52\nHoly moley, the {PriceIndices} package calls month() and year(), used to extract elements of a date, over 1400 times combined.\n\n\nUnique function use by package\nWe can also look at things like the packages that make calls to the greatest number of unique {lubridate} functions. Here’s the top 5.\n\nfn_distinct_count &lt;- dep_df |&gt;\n  filter(pkg == \"lubridate\") |&gt;\n  distinct(focus, fun) |&gt;\n  count(focus, sort = TRUE) \n\nfn_distinct_count |&gt; slice(1:5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  focus              n\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 photobiology      26\n2 mctq              25\n3 fmdates           21\n4 finbif            15\n5 xml2relational    15\nSo these packages are using more than 10 unique functions from {lubridate}, which is pretty extensive usage. It may be tricky to do away with the convenience of the dependnecy in these cases, especially.\nConversely, a quick histogram reveals that a large number of packages are actually using just a single {lubridate} function.\n\nhist(\n  fn_distinct_count$n,\n  breaks = 30,\n  main = \"Unique {lubridate} functions used by\\npackages importing {lubridate}\",\n  xlab = \"Function count\"\n)\n\n\nMaybe the dependency could be dropped in these cases?\nOut of interest, which {lubridate} function is the most frequent in packages that use just one?\n\nfocus_one_fn &lt;- fn_distinct_count |&gt;\n  filter(n == 1) |&gt;\n  pull(focus)\n\npkg_fn_count |&gt; \n  filter(focus %in% focus_one_fn) |&gt; \n  count(fun, sort = TRUE) |&gt; \n  slice(1:5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  fun             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 as_datetime     7\n2 as_date         6\n3 ymd             6\n4 ymd_hms         6\n5 is.Date         4\nLooks like some pretty standard functions, like converting to a date (as_date(), as_datetime()) or to parse dates with a particular time component (ymd_hms for year, month, date, hour, minute, seconds, and ymd()).\nI think this is interesting: some packages are importing {lubridate} in its entirety to use a single function. And these functions have base R equivalents with no package-dependency cost. Without diving too deep, this implies that people are using {lubridate} because of syntax familiarity or perhaps because they’re already loading other tidyverse packages anyway.\n\n\nNon-unique function use by package\nWhat about total calls to {lubridate} functions by each of the dependent package? This is on-unique, so could include one function being called multiple times by a given package.\n\nfn_nondistinct_count &lt;- dep_df |&gt;\n  filter(pkg == \"lubridate\") |&gt;\n  count(focus, sort = TRUE)\n\ndep_df |&gt; \n  count(focus) |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    fn_nondistinct_count,\n    by = \"focus\",\n    suffix = c(\"_total\", \"_lub\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(percent_lub = round(100 * n_lub / n_total, 1)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(percent_lub)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  focus        n_total n_lub percent_lub\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 RClimacell      2241   225        10  \n2 riem             113     9         8  \n3 quantdates       534    42         7.9\n4 rtrends          101     8         7.9\n5 PriceIndices   23235  1805         7.8\nWow, 10% of calls by the {RClimacell} package involve {lubridate} functions. Make sense: this package relates to weather readings at certain time intervals.\nAnd another quick histogram of what the distribution looks like.\n\nhist(\n  fn_nondistinct_count$n,\n  breaks = 30,\n  main = \"Non-unique {lubridate} functions used by\\npackages importing {lubridate}\",\n  xlab = \"Function count\"\n)\n\n\nHuh, so the number of non-unique {lubridate} calls is almost always less than 50 per package. Seems in general that a small number of {lubridate} functions are called per dependent package, but they might be called a lot."

    "text": "Al Addin\nRStudio Addins let you access R functions interactively at the click of a button (or with a keyboard shortcut, or via the RStudio command palette). I particularly like them for easy sharing of insertable pre-written code.\nSee Dean Attali’s {addinslist} package for examples or the {shrtcts} package by Garrick Aden-Buie for an alternative approach to ‘make anything an RStudio shortcut’.\nOn my part:\n\nI wrote about the little {backtick} Addin package that inserts backticks (`) and backtick constructions1\nI wrote about the {r2eng} package, which has an Addin that lets you highlight some R code and then speak that expression out loud in English\nI wrote about the {blogsnip} Addin package that can manipulate code used to write this blog\nthe {a11ytables} package has an Addin to insert code skeletons for creating publishable best-practice spreadsheets\n\nRStudio Addins are kinda straightforward to put into in an R package. Put your functions in R/ as usual, then write an inst/rstudio/addins.dcf file to declare your functions (e.g. see {backtick}’s .dcf). Learn more from Sharon Machlis and Jozef Hajnala.\nThe user can then select the functions from the ‘Addins’ dropdown in the RStudio IDE.\nOf late I’ve written two packages—{quartostamp} and {snorkel}—that contain RStudio Addins to help me write code structures that I struggle to remember when writing Quarto documents and function documentation.\nOthers seem to have found these useful, so I thought I’d ‘officially’ signal that they exist."

    "text": "Package {quartostamp}\n\nQuarto—‘new R Markdown’—is all the rage right now, having been officially launched at the recent rstudio::conf(2022) conference. Folks are going bonkers for tools and techniques to learn and implement it. A good place to begin is the Awesome Quarto List by Mickaël Canouil.\nFeatured there is {quartostamp}, a little R package I made that contains an RStudio Addin to insert into your Quarto doc a number of useful divs and classes. As the README puts it:\n\nWhy ‘quartostamp’? You could physically stamp some pre-prepared type into a literal quarto document; you can digitally stamp some pre-written elements into your qmd file.\n\n\n\n\nHex logo for {quartostamp}.\n\n\nYou can install it from GitHub like:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/quartostamp\")\n\nAs an example, did you forget how to insert speaker notes into a presentation? Go to Addins &gt; Insert Speaker Notes and this will be inserted to your doc:\n::: {.notes}\nSpeaker notes go here.\n:::\nThat’s a straightforward one; a two-column layout is more complex. Go to Addins &gt; Insert Column Layout and you get this:\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width='40%'}\nLeft column\n:::\n\n::: {.column width='60%'}\nRight column\n:::\n\n::::\nThese elements are basically lifted from the docs, so big shoutout to the authors JJ Allaire, Charles Teague, Carlos Scheidegger, Yihui Xie and Christophe Dervieux.\nGo to the package website to see the current list of functions available in the Addin. Click them to learn more, including a preview of the actual text that will be inserted into your document.\nI think the limits of the package are the content that you would insert in the body of your Quarto doc, or to places like Revealjs slide headings. In other words, not Quarto YAML nor chunk options. These are autocompleted in RStudio, or otherwise dealt with already elsewhere.\nDo submit your ideas for {quartodown} as issues or pull requests in the GitHub repo.\n\n Note\nThe package was updated in June 2023 to version 0.1.0, which lets you highlight some text and run the addin so that the selected text becomes the body of the stamp. A simple dummy skeleton is inserted if you use the addin without highlighting any text, as described above.\nFor example, you can write some bullets, highlight them, select ‘Insert Speaker Notes’ and you’ll get the appropriate markup for those bullets to be rendered as speaker notes in your Quarto presentation."

    "text": "Package {snorkel}\n\nThe {snorkel} package2 is another solution to storing syntax outside of my own brain. In this case, it helps out with formatting text in {roxygen2} function documentation.3\nThe reason for the name should be obvious.4 As the package README puts it:\n\nYou put a snorkel in your mouth to help you breathe oxygen; you put a {snorkel} in your addins to help you write with {roxygen2}.\n\nYes, this is package-name-driven development; I thought of the name before writing anything.\nInstall from GitHub like:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/snorkel\")\n\nSo, how would you embolden a word in your function documentation? Highlight the word and then go to Addins &gt; Format Bold and you get:\n#' I am a \\strong{bold} boy.\nHere’s something more complex: how can you link to a function in an external package? Write the package function in the form package::function, highlight it and then select Addins &gt; Link To Function (Another Package) and you get:\n#' When the crowd say 'Bo \\code{\\link[dplyr]{select}}a'.\nThe functions in the Addin insert code mentioned in the {roxygen2} docs, so big shoutout to the authors Hadley Wickham, Peter Danenberg, Gabor Csárdi, Manuel Eugster and RStudio.\nThe package website has a list of the functions available in the Addin,5 which you can click to see previews of what each one will insert.\nFor now I think the functions in the package should focus just on the Rd tags that format the documentation, rather than the {roxygen2} tags (like @description, @params, etc). The latter are already autocompleted in RStudio, so I feel like there’s less need. Similarly, the package doesn’t include functions to insert Markdown into function documentation, but perhaps it could be expanded in future.\nNew functionality is always welcome; please raise an issue or pull request in the GitHub repo."

Please add any suggestions or features in an issue or pull request in either GitHub repo.\nSo, don’t be a cad, it would be maddenin’ and saddenin’ if you hadn’t added in your Addin ideas, so be a rad chad and add your addins in the Addins."

    "text": "Break the lyrics down\n\nWords\n\nExtract\nNow we’ve got the lines separated, we can bring in the {tidytext} package from Julia Silge and David Robinson to break the lines into ‘tokens’ for further text analysis. Tokens are individual units of text prepared for analysis. In our case, we’re looking at individual words, or ‘unigrams’.\nWe should probabaly remove stop words. These are words don’t really have much meaning in this context because of their ubiquity, like ‘if’, ‘and’ and ‘but’. We can get rid of these by anti-joining a pre-prepared list of such words.\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nye_words &lt;- ye_lyrics %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(word, line) %&gt;%  # separate out tokens\n  anti_join(tidytext::stop_words)  # remove 'if', 'and', etc\n\nye_words %&gt;%\n  sample_n(5) %&gt;% \n  select(word, song_name) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\nword\nsong_name\n\n\n\n\nyesterday\nViolent Crimes\n\n\ndrop\nI Thought About Killing You\n\n\nhuh\nYikes\n\n\npublicly\nWouldn’t Leave\n\n\ndrama’ll\nGhost Town\n\n\n\nNote that this isn’t completely successful. Kanye also uses colloquialisms and words like ‘ima’; a contraction of two stop words that isn’t represented in our stop-word dictionary.\n\n\nCount words\nNow we’ve tokenised the lyrics to removed stopwords, let’s also show this as a plot. For simplicity, we’ll show only the words that appeared more than five times.\nI’ve sampled even colours from the album cover of ye, stored as hexadecimal values in a named vector. We can select from these to decorate our plot, because why not. The album cover is a Wyoming mountainscape, taken on Kanye’s own iPhone shortly before he held a listening party for the new album. Scrawled in green lettering over the image is the phrase ‘I hate being Bi-Polar it’s awesome’.\n\nye_cols &lt;- c(\n  mountain_blue = \"#233956\",\n  grass_blue = \"#0e1e27\",\n  cloud_blue1 = \"#7a8aa2\",\n  cloud_white = \"#dfd7c9\",\n  cloud_grey = \"#b5b2b0\",\n  cloud_blue2 = \"#9da3ae\",\n  text_green = \"#31ef56\"\n)\n\nOkay, on with the plot.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nye_words %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%  # tally words\n  filter(n &gt; 5) %&gt;%  # more than 5 occurrences \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;%  # order by count\n  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = ye_cols[\"mountain_blue\"]) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Frequency of words in 'ye' (2018) by Kanye West\",\n    subtitle = \"Using the geniusr and tidytext packages\",\n    x = \"\", y = \"Count\",\n    caption = \"Lyrics from genius.com\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(  # apply ye theming\n    plot.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_white\"]),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_white\"]),\n    plot.caption = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_blue1\"]),\n    axis.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"text_green\"]),\n    axis.text = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"text_green\"]),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols[\"grass_blue\"]),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols[\"cloud_grey\"]),\n    panel.grid = element_line(ye_cols[\"cloud_grey\"])\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nBigrams\n\nExtract\nTokenising by individual words is fine, but we aren’t restricted to unigrams. We can also tokenise by bigrams, which are pairs of adjacent words. For example, ‘damn croissant’ is a bigram in the sentence ‘hurry up with my damn croissaint’.\n\nye_bigrams &lt;- ye_lyrics %&gt;%\n  unnest_tokens(\n    bigram,\n    line,\n    token = \"ngrams\",\n    n = 2\n  )\n\nRemoving stopwords is tricker than for tokenising by word. We should tokenise by bigram first, then separate the words and match them to our stopword list.\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nye_bigrams_separated &lt;- ye_bigrams %&gt;%\n  separate(bigram, c(\"word1\", \"word2\"), sep = \" \")\n\nThen we can filter to remove the stopwords.\n\nye_bigrams_filtered &lt;- ye_bigrams_separated %&gt;%\n  dplyr::filter(\n    !word1 %in% stop_words$word,\n    !word2 %in% stop_words$word\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(bigram = paste(word1, word2))\n\nThe results look a bit like this:\n\nye_bigrams_filtered %&gt;% \n  sample_n(5) %&gt;% \n  select(bigram, song_name) %&gt;%\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\nbigram\nsong_name\n\n\n\n\nbleed yeah\nGhost Town\n\n\nfallin dreamin\nViolent Crimes\n\n\npremeditated murder\nI Thought About Killing You\n\n\ngonna leave\nAll Mine\n\n\nayy i’ma\nAll Mine\n\n\n\n\n\nCount bigrams\nSo let’s plot the most frequent bigram occurrences, like we did for the single words\n\nye_bigrams_filtered %&gt;%\n  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  filter(n &gt; 3) %&gt;%\n  mutate(bigram = reorder(bigram, n)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(bigram, n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = ye_cols[\"mountain_blue\"]) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Frequency of bigrams in 'ye' (2018) by Kanye West\",\n    subtitle = \"Using the geniusr and tidytext packages\",\n    x = \"\", y = \"Count\",\n    caption = \"Lyrics from genius.com\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_white\"]),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_white\"]),\n    plot.caption = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_blue1\"]),\n    axis.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"text_green\"]),\n    axis.text = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"text_green\"]),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols[\"grass_blue\"]),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols[\"cloud_grey\"]),\n    panel.grid = element_line(ye_cols[\"cloud_grey\"])\n  )"

    "text": "What did we learn?\nIt’s difficult to get a deep insight from looking at individual words from a 24-minute, seven-song album. You might argue that looking for deep insight from Kanye West’s lyrics is a fool’s errand anyway.\nDespite this, ‘love’ and ‘feel’ were in the top 10, which might indicate Kanye expressing his feelings. ‘Bad’, ‘mistake’ and ‘pray’ were also repeated a bunch of times, which might also indicate what’s on Ye’s mind.\nMost of the other most common words should probably have been removed as stop words but weren’t in our stop-word dictionary (e.g. ‘yeah’, ‘mhm’, ‘i’ma’, ‘gon’, ‘ayy’, ‘wanna’). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the flexibility of various swear words means they’re pretty high up the list.\nWe’ve seen how simple it is to use the {geniusr} functions search_artist(), get_artist_meta(), get_artist_songs(), get_songs_meta() and scrape_lyrics_url() in conjunction with {purrr}, followed by some tidytext.\nThe next step might be to look at Ye’s entire back catalogue and see how his lyrics have changed over time and how they compare to ye in particular.\nObviously I only made this post for the ‘tid-ye-text’ pun, so take it or leave it."

    "text": "{targets}\nReproducibility is an important part of any data analysis. Will people be able to re-run your code from scratch on a different machine without you present?\nR has lots of solutions for making your analysis reproducible, but one thing that gets overlooked is the reproducibility of the workflow itself. In other words, the interdependencies between functions, file and objects and the order in which they run.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R package {targets} ‘remembers’ these relationships. In short, {targets} makes sure that only the impacted objects are re-run when you update your analysis. This means you don’t have to recreate everything from scratch each time.\nA very basic overview of using {targets}:\n\nWrite a pipeline script\nInspect the pipeline (including visually)\nExecute the pipeline\nChange stuff\nGo to 2\n\nWith functions:\n\ntar_script() creates a _targets.R file, which is where you declare you write functions and options and create your targets with tar_targets(), declaring the pipeline with tar_pipeline()\ntar_manifest() lets you check the configuration of your targets\ntar_visnetwork visualises your pipeline as a graph network\ntar_make() executes your pipeline, which caches outputs and metadata in a _targets/ directory that can be read from with tar_read() and tar_load() (you could use )\ntar_outdated() prints any targets that need to be updated following any changes to other targets, after which you can reinspect your pipeline and re-make it\n\nI’m not going to use this post to explain how to use the package in depth, but do check out the {targets} manual or the many other resources I’ve listed in the resources section below."

    "text": "But… {drake}?\nYou may have noticed I have cunningly plagiarised myself by re-using slides from a presentation to Bioinformatics London in January 2020.\n\nThat presentation was about {drake}, another workflow reproducibility package by Will Landau. I also wrote about the {drake} package as a tool for the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) movement in UK government.\nSo what’s the difference between the two packages? In Will’s own words:\n\nyears of community feedback [on {drake}] have exposed major user-side limitations regarding data management, collaboration, parallel efficiency, and pipeline archetypes\n\n{drake} is the more mature package and certainly it works, but {targets} is designed to address certain {drake} issues that only became apparent with ongoing, large-scale user testing in the wild. While {targets} addresses these problems, it’s worth noting that it’s still in development (v0.0.0.9002 at time of writing) and changes may be implemented that limit the usefulness of this post in future.\nOn the plus side, the {targets} package–along with the helper package {tarchetypes}, which I haven’t had time to mention here–is going through a peer review with rOpenSci (as of October 2020), which will help perfect the package and give people even greater confidence in its suitability for everyday use.\nUltimately it’s up to the user to decide which package they’d prefer to use for now, but {targets} looks to be the future for workflow reproducibility implemented within the R ecosystem."

It’s not perfect, but it’s close enough.\nTo summarise the code, it first opens the png() graphics device; sets par()ameters to exclude margins and set the background colour; plot()s an empty plot; builds lines with x and y coordinates; builds circle segments with x, y, radius and theta; and finally closes the device with dev.off().\n\n\nRemix\nThere’s some great remixes on the #RecreationThursday hashtag in Twitter and I particularly liked the ones that went for slight variations in stroke and placement, as well as those with an animated approach.\nIn this vein, I chose to vary randomly the elements of the plot using a custom function, vary_hlito().\nThe randomisation was relatively simplistic: vary the y-axis location of each of the horizontal lines, but maintain their widths and colours; provide different segment lengths for each of the two circles while retaining their radii and centres; vary the length and placement of the diagonal line running top-left to bottom-right.\nThere’s a number of ways to present these ‘rando-Hlitos’. I thought it would be interesting to do two things: create a large grid of many recreations (i.e. create a ‘meta’ rando-Hlito) and create an animation (i.e. a sequential reveal of many recreations). I think these are interesting in different ways.\nIn particular, I think the 10 by 10 grid echoes two completely different styles: the repeating nature is a bit like a moquette pattern from the London Underground, while the colours and shapes aren’t far off a 90s Memphis Style.\nTo summarise the code, the grid was created by setting a 10 by 10 panel with mfrow = c(10, 10) passed to par() and then different seeds were passed into vary_hlito() with purrr::walk() to dictate the randomness. The animation was generated by looping over randomly-selected seeds and saving each output as a PNG, before stitching these frames into a gif with the {magick} package."

    "text": "2. Getting too attached\nThis problem begins with a question: how does R know where to look for a variable?\nHere’s three ways to calculate Pokémon body mass index by reference to variables in a data set:\n\n# Read Pokémon data from URL\ndf &lt;- suppressMessages(readr::read_csv(\n  \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwdray/datasets/master/pokemon_go_captures.csv\",\n))\n\n# BMI calculation three ways\nx &lt;- mean(df$weight_kg / df$height_m ^ 2)  # dollar notation\ny &lt;- mean(df[[\"weight_kg\"]] / df[[\"height_m\"]] ^ 2)  # square brackets\nz &lt;- with(df, mean(weight_kg / height_m ^ 2))  # with() function\n\n# All produce the same results?\nall(x == y, y == z, x == z)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nSo each line specifies the data frame object where R should look for the named variables. If you don’t provide this object, R will error:\n\nmean(weight_kg / height_m ^ 2)\n\n## Error in mean(weight_kg / height_m ^ 2) : object 'weight_kg' not found\nR was searching for the weight_kg variable in a few places, starting with the global environment, but couldn’t find it. You can see the search path it takes:\n\nsearch()\n\n[1] \".GlobalEnv\"        \"package:stats\"     \"package:graphics\" \n[4] \"package:grDevices\" \"package:utils\"     \"package:datasets\" \n[7] \"package:methods\"   \"Autoloads\"         \"package:base\"     \n\n\nThe data object isn’t in there, so that’s why it can’t find those variables.\nPast-Matthew got around this by using attach(), which lets you add objects to the search path.\n\nattach(df)\nsearch()  # now 'df' is in the search path\n\n [1] \".GlobalEnv\"        \"df\"                \"package:stats\"    \n [4] \"package:graphics\"  \"package:grDevices\" \"package:utils\"    \n [7] \"package:datasets\"  \"package:methods\"   \"Autoloads\"        \n[10] \"package:base\"     \n\n\nThe following expression can now be calculated because R can find the variable names in the attached df object.\n\nmean(weight_kg / height_m ^ 2)\n\n[1] 31.17416\n\n\nSo we never need to refer to the data frame name at all. Wow, how can that be bad?\nHere’s one reason. Consider a data set with column names that match our original:\n\ndf2 &lt;- df[species == \"caterpie\", ]\nattach(df2)\n\nThe following objects are masked from df:\n\n    charge_attack, combat_power, fast_attack, height_bin, height_m,\n    hit_points, species, weight_bin, weight_kg\n\n\nYou might be able to guess the problem: R will get variables from df2 first, since it was the most recently attached.\nBad news: this means the code we wrote earlier will get a different result.\n\nmean(weight_kg / height_m ^ 2)\n\n[1] 31.64357\n\n\nThis has serious implications for reproducibility and the confidence you can have in your results.\nSee also the ‘search list shuffle’ danger of attach() referenced in Circle 8.1.35 of The R Inferno by Patrick Burns.\nPast-Matthew was using this approach because he was taught with Mick Crawley’s R Book. Mick says attach() ‘makes the code easier to understand for beginners’ (page 18)2 — possibly because expressions end up looking less cluttered. But this only sets up beginners (like me) for problems later. In fact, Mick even says, perhaps confusingly, to ‘avoid using attach wherever possible’ in his book.\nPro tip: if you do ever use attach() (don’t), you’ll want to make sure you detach() your objects from the search path.\n\ndetach(df)\ndetach(df2)\n\n\n\n\nBemusement."

Maybe results is now out of date because the code has been updated.\nI’m also certain that the content of past-Matthew’s workspace was being saved at the end of each session — the default behaviour — meaning all that trash would come back next time he fired up R.\nThere were also some strange defensive lines like the following, which pre-emptively unloads the {nlme} package because of a namespace conflict with {lme4}:\n\ndetach(\"package:nlme\")  # conflicts with lme4\n\nI assume this was because past-Matthew was never quite sure of the state of his current working environment.\nThese days I treat everything in my environment with suspicion and restart R regularly and rebuild objects from scratch. This means I can have confidence that my script does what I think it does and also stops interference from older objects that are clogging up my environment.\nI also modified the default behaviour of RStudio to prevent my workspace being saved, which means I can start afresh when I open a project.

You can then loop over the variables of interest to get your results.\nThe effort of learning to write your own functions is worth it to avoid the problems. See R for Data Science for more on this.\nHere’s one way to tackle the code repetition above:\n\n# Function to calcuate a rounded mean value for a given species\nget_sp_mean &lt;- function(\n  sp, data = df, var = \"weight_kg\", dp = 2\n) {\n  \n  sub_sp &lt;- subset(data, species == sp)  # subset data\n  mean_sp &lt;- round(mean(sub_sp[[var]]), dp)  # get mean\n  return(mean_sp)  # function will output the mean value\n  \n}\n\n# Create a named vector to iterate over\nspecies &lt;- c(\"koffing\", \"paras\", \"geodude\")\nnames(species) &lt;- species  # make it a named vector\n\n# Iterate over the vector to apply the function\npurrr::map(species, get_sp_mean)\n\n$koffing\n[1] 0.92\n\n$paras\n[1] 5.39\n\n$geodude\n[1] 23.24\n\n\nFriendship ended with code repetition. Now bespoke functions and {purrr} are my best friends.\n\n\n\nEmpathy."

I think Timpe selected this set of colours to match the colours available from Lego sets.\n\nBoring, boring Arsenal\nTo actually build the model, pass the data frame to a couple of {brickr} functions.\nThe first is bricks_from_table() that converts the data frame to a list containing several elements that define the required bricks and colours.\n\n# Convert plan to list with brick types and colours\nplayer_bricks &lt;- player_plan %&gt;%\n  bricks_from_table()\n\nnames(player_bricks)  # see the element names\n\n[1] \"Img_lego\"      \"brickr_object\" \"Img_bricks\"    \"ID_bricks\"    \n[5] \"pieces\"        \"use_bricks\"   \n\n\nAs a side note, you can use display_pieces() to find out the set of pieces you’ll need to recreate the model in real life!\n\nbuild_pieces(player_bricks)\n\n\n\n\nPass the list object to the display_bricks() function to get the plan rendered into 3D. This opens a new device window and the model will be built up layer by layer. When complete, you can use your mouse to click and drag the object to look at at from all directions.\n\nbuild_bricks(player_bricks)  # opens separate window\n\n\nSo the default set builds up to make a player that has red socks with white trim, white shorts, and a red shirt with white sleeves. An Arsenal player, of course.3\n\n\nShow your support\nTo change the colour of the player’s shirt you just need to change all the bricks associated with the shirt. This could be tedious by hand, so create_brickr_player() has an argument to do exactly this. Set shirt_body_col to ‘6’ to make it bright blue, for example.\nYou can change more than the shirt colour. Here’s the current set of arguments:\n\nshirt_body_col and shirt_sleeve_col\nshorts_col\nsock_col and sock_trim_col\nboot_col\nhair_col and skin_col\n\nSo you could create a Manchester City player with the following:\n\n# Build player plan with certain colours\nman_city &lt;- create_brickr_player(\n  hair_col = 6,           # Black\n  skin_col = 34,          # Dark brown\n  boot_col = 3,           # Bright red\n  shirt_body_col = 30,    # Light royal blue\n  shirt_sleeve_col = 30,  # Light royal blue\n  shorts_col = 1,         # White\n  sock_col = 16,          # Earth blue\n  sock_trim_col = 16      # Earth blue\n)\n\n# Convert plan to list and render it\nman_city %&gt;%\n  bricks_from_table() %&gt;%\n  display_bricks()\n\n\nIn fact, this is a faithful rendering of the 2019 Premier League winner, FA Cup winner, League Cup winner, PFA Team of the Year inductee, PFA Young Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year Raheem Sterling. Obviously.\nI’ve added a couple more to a GitHub Gist. Feel free to add more."

I realise that might be a niche audience.\nThe obvious next step would be to allow for features of the plan to change. For example, you could set an argument for player_height and add or remove layers from the plan to make the final model taller or shorter. Or maybe different shirt types could be specified, like horizontal_stripe = TRUE.\nPull requests always welcome!"

This post covers a simple workflow to get you started, but full Swirlify guidance is available.\n\nGet up and running\nCreate a new lesson folder (‘Lesson 1’), which will be autopopulated with template files for your lesson. This will also create a new parent course folder (‘New Course’) if it doesn’t already exist.\n\nlibrary(swirl)  # install.packages(\"swirl\")\nlibrary(swirlify)  # install.packages(\"swirlify\")\nnew_lesson(course_name = \"New Course\", lesson_name = \"Lesson 1\")\n\nThe following folder structure is generated:\nWorking directory/\n└── New_Course/\n    └── Lesson_1/\n        ├── customTests.R\n        ├── dependson.txt\n        ├── initLesson.R\n        └── lesson.yaml\nThe lesson.yaml file is the most important one. It’s basically a text file where each question is stored as text. Users advance through each of these questions when they run the lesson.\nThe lesson file can be edited directly, but we’ll focus on the built-in Swirlify Shiny app for simplicity:\n\nswirlify(course_name = \"New Course\", lesson_name = \"Lesson 1\")\n\nThe app will open the named lesson from the named course in a new browser window. On the left is where you create new questions. On the right you can see the lesson.yaml file itself.\n\nNote the ‘Help’ tab, which tells you about the types of questions you can make, or you can see the Swirlify guidance). Basically the question types are:\n\n‘message’ for informational text (not for questions per se)\n‘command’ for answers that require simple R expressions as answers\n‘numerical’ and ‘text’ for answers that are numbers or words\n‘multiple choice’ for multiple choice (as in the figure above)\n‘figure’ and ‘video’ for referring to media (‘video’ can take a user to any URL)\n‘script’ for longer R expressions that requires you to write custom answer tests (this is more advanced)\n\nTo build a question:\n\nChoose a question type from the dropdown menu on the left\nFill in the text boxes (note that the answer tests box is completed for you if you type into the correct answer box and then press the ‘Make Answer Test from Correct Answer’ button)\nClick the ‘Add Question’ button see the question added to the file (on the right hand side)\nClick ‘Save Lesson’\nRun test_lesson() to look for errors\nClick ‘Demo Lesson’ to try it out\n\n\nContinue adding questions until the lesson is complete. Then:\n\nRun add_to_manifest() to add the lesson to the MANIFEST file (it’ll be created in the course directory if it doesn’t already exist). Lessons in here are recognised as part of the course in the declared order.\nUse new_lesson() to create a new one, remembering to change the lesson_name argument and also add this lesson to the MANIFEST as well.\n\nYou should end up with a folder structure like this:\nWorking directory/\n└── New_Course/\n    ├── Lesson_1/\n    |   ├── customTests.R\n    |   ├── dependson.txt\n    |   ├── initLesson.R\n    |   └── lesson.yaml\n    ├─ Lesson_2/\n    |   ├── customTests.R\n    |   ├── dependson.txt\n    |   ├── initLesson.R\n    |   └── lesson.yaml\n    └─ MANIFEST\nWhen your lessons are completed, you’re ready to share your course. Jump now to the share your course section or first learn some extra knowledge about lesson file structure, correct answers or lesson startup below.\n\n\nExtra knowledge\nClearly the process of course building is more nuanced than outlined above, but you can learn more from the documentation on the Swirlify site and reference manual. In particular, See the course structure and writing lessons pages of the Swirlify guidance.\nI’ll touch on three things here: lesson file structure, correct answers and lesson start-up.\n\nLesson file structure\nThe lesson file is written in YAML, which is basically a special form of plain text. Questions appear as separate blocks of text that start with a hyphen and a question type (class) declaration, followed by further arguments on new indented lines.\nThe first block is always Class: meta and provides basic information about the file, like your name and the lesson name. Another simple one is Class: text to which you supply only one more argument, the Output, which is text to display to the user.\n\n- Class: text\n  Output: Did I mention chocolate hobnobs are great?\n\nThere are actually three ways to add questions:\n\nIn the Shiny app, as outlined earlier in this post.\nBy using the wq_*() family of functions to add questions to the active lesson – wq_message(output = \"Text here\") adds informative text, for example.\nBy writing directly into the YAML file.\n\nThere’s more on questions classes and how to write them in the Swirlify guidance.\n\n\nCorrect answers\nHow are answers encoded and checked in lesson.yaml? Consider the YAML for this question:\n\n- Class: cmd_question\n  Output: Use mean() to calculate the mean of the numbers 1 to 5.\n  CorrectAnswer: mean(1:5)\n  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(1:5'))\n  Hint: Use the form x:y to provide numbers to mean().\n\nSo CorrectAnswer is where you provide the correct answer (!). This line will be run if the user chooses to skip() the question. AnswerTests is, however, what the user’s input will actually be evaluated against. It uses the omnitest function to compare the correct expression (correctExpr) to the user’s answer.\nBut often there’s more than one way to answer. The any_of_exprs() function should be used in this case.\n\n- Class: cmd_question\n  Output: Use mean() to calculate the mean of the numbers 1 to 5.\n  CorrectAnswer: mean(1:5)\n  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mean(1:5)', 'mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))')\n  Hint: You can use the form x:y or c(x, y) to provide numbers to mean().\n\nThere’s more on answer testing in the Swirlify guidance, including how to write custom answer tests.\n\n\nLesson start-up\nAnything in the initLesson.R file will be run when the lesson is loaded. You can create objects and refer to them in your questions. For example, you could add a data frame:\n\nbiscuits &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Chocolate hobnob\", \"Digestive\", \"Custard cream\"),\n  rating = c(10, 5, 7) \n)\n\nYou could then ask in lesson.yaml something like:\n\n- Class: cmd_question\n  Output: Use index notation to subset for biscuits rated over 5.\n  CorrectAnswer: biscuits[biscuits$rating &gt; 5, ]\n  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='biscuits[, biscuits$rating &gt; 5]')\n  Hint: Remember the indexing format dataframe[rows, columns].\n\nThe data frame was loaded on start-up, so the user can interact with it to answer the question.\nYou can also add data sets to the lesson folder and read them into the user’s environment via the initLesson.R file. See the Swirlify guidance on including data for more information.\n\n\n\nShare your course\nCongratulations. You’re ready to share your course.\nThere are several ways to do this. It’s easiest for learners to use Swirl’s swirl::install_course_*() functions to install courses from:\n\na GitHub repo\na zip file stored on DropBox, Google Drive, or some URL\na course folder—zipped or not—-downloaded locally on their machine\n\nYou can also compress your course to a single .swc file with compress_course() and raise a pull request for it to be hosted on the Swirl Course Network. It can be downloaded from there with install_course().\nSwirl is strengthened by having a greater number and range of courses."

    "text": "Version control\nIt’s good to store intermediate versions of your files. The process of ‘version controlling’ means you can revert to prior states and prevents the confusion of having folders filled with things like file_FINAL.txt, file_comments2.txt and file_comments_FINAL.txt. Version control can be achieved in a number of ways, but one popular approach is to use Git software and the GitHub website.\n\nTools\n\nGit is an open-source version control system that tracks file changes on your computer, records why they were made and lets you revert to a past state if something goes wrong. Alternatives include Mercurial and Apache Subversion.\n\nGitHub is a Microsoft-owned website where you can store the Git history of your files remotely on the web. It acts as a place to inspect your version history in the browser; lets other people see your code in the open, use it themselves and collaborate with you; lets you record issues and to-do items; and much, much more. Alternative products include GitLab and BitBucket.\n\n\nThis post\nThe goal of this post is to put a new project folder under version control with Git and then upload the version history to GitHub. I assume you’re a beginner and are, for now, working alone on a project.1\nWe’ll be using the bash language at the command line to do all of this. In this post, lines should be typed into the command line when the example starts with a $ (you don’t need to type the dollar symbol yourself).\nThe command line is the place where you write instructions directly to your computer and you can access it via software like ‘Terminal’ on a Mac. You may want to see my earlier post for how to get basic stuff done at the command line before you continue.\nIt’s okay if you aren’t comfortable the command line. The bottom line is to get your work under some form of version control. You could always use GitHub’s drag and drop interface without needing to use the command line at all. There are guides available for using GitHub without using the command line."

Click a link to jump to that section.\n\nOne-time tasks:\n\nInstall Git\nCreate a GitHub account\n\nProject set-up:\n\nCreate your project folder\nInitiate Git\nCreate a .gitignore file\nCreate a remote GitHub repository\n\nA Git/GitHub workflow:\n\nWork on your files\nCheck file status\nAdd changes\nCommit changes\nAdd and edit files (repeat as necessary)\nPush changes to GitHub\nClone the repo to your machine\n\n\n\n1. One-time tasks\nYou need to install Git on each computer you’ll be working from (feasibly only one computer), but only need to sign up once for GitHub.\n\nInstall Git\nGit is basically a bunch of functions you can use via the command line, with each command preceded with the word git.\nYou can check to see if Git is installed on your machine by asking for its version number from the command line:\n\n$ git --version\n\ngit version 2.20.1 (Apple Git-117)\nThis response shows that I already have Git installed. If the git command isn’t recognised then you will need to download Git and install it.\nOnce installed, Git needs to know who you are so that file changes can be ascribed to you. Introduce yourself by supplying your name and email address:\n\n$ git config --global user.name 'Your Name'\n$ git config --global user.email 'youremail@address.com'\n\nThese details are written to a special configuration file. You can print its contents to check it’s worked:\n\n$ git config --global --list\n\nuser.name=Your Name\nuser.email=youremail@address.com\n\n\nCreate a GitHub account\nGitHub is free to use but you need an account. Go to the GitHub website and click ‘Sign-up for GitHub’. You’ll need to provide a username, email address and password.\n\nWhen prompted for a subscription level, choose ‘free subscription’. You’ll be able to do everything you need to do with this type of account; a premium account is more suitable for teams.\nYou’ll be sent an automated email to verify your email address. Click the button in the email to confirm, then check that your GitHub profile page is viewable at github.com/yourusername.\n\n\n\n2. Project set-up\nThe following subsections are about creating a project folder and putting it under version control by activating Git.\n\nCreate your project folder\nIt’s good practice for each project to exist in its own repository (folder), so all the code, data, tests and documentation are in the same place. Let’s create a project folder now.\nUsing the command line, navigate with cd to where we want the folder to be, create it with mkdir and then navigate into it:\n\n$ cd ~/Documents\n$ mkdir demo-project\n$ cd demo-project\n$ pwd\n\n/Users/matt/Documents/demo-project\nYou could also create a new folder by pointing and clicking; just make sure you navigate to the folder at the command line with cd.\n\n\nInitiate Git\nSo we have our empty project folder, but it’s not yet under version control. How can we make Git aware of this folder and start tracking changes? We can initiate Git there:\n\n$ git init\n\nInitialized empty Git repository in /Users/matt/Documents/demo-project/.git\nWhat did this do? If you look inside the folder through your file explorer you’ll see nothing new. But look what happens when you ask at the command line to list (ls) all (the -A flag) the files and folders (marked by a / with the -p flag):\n\n$ ls -A -p\n\n.git/\nSo the project folder actually contains a folder called .git. This is where the version information will be stored, among other things. Why can’t you see it from your file explorer? Because it starts with a period, which marks it as a hidden file not to be shown unless specifically asked for.\nNote that we haven’t yet recorded any versions; we’ve just added the relevant file structure for Git to operate in our project repository.\n\n\nCreate a .gitignore file\nThere are files that you may not want to put under version control. This might include sensitive files, large data sets or language-specific artefacts.\nYou can list such files in a special .gitignore file that tells Git not to worry about recording changes. Note that this file starts with a period, so it’s a hidden file like the .git file in the last section.\nTo create a gitignore file, navigate to your project file and use touch to create it and then open it with your computer’s default text editor (you can also edit it from the command line itself).\n\n$ touch .gitignore\n$ open .gitignore\n\nNow to add things to the gitignore file. You could start by copying from a template, like the one for R. As an example, the first file in that template is .Rhistory – a log of all the commands you’ve typed – which you probably don’t need to track.\nYou could add things to your gitignore like sensitive-data.csv to ignore a specific data set, or something like *.csv (meaning any file name that ends with .csv) to ignore all files of a particular type. Mac users will also want to add .DS_Store, which is a kind of Mac-specific metadata file.\n\n\nCreate a remote GitHub repository\nEverything we’ve done so far is on your machine; it’s all ‘local’. All the files we add and change will be local until we choose to send a copy of the information to GitHub.\nNow we’re going to create a repository (folder) for the local information to be stored on GitHub. This location is ‘remote’. We’re doing this now as part of the project set-up steps, but you needn’t necessarily do it until later when you finally want to upload your version control history to GitHub.\nTo begin, make sure you’re logged into GitHub and click the ‘plus’ symbol in the upper right corner and then ‘New repository’. You can then input a repository name (i.e. the name of the project folder you created) and a short description.\n\nYou can choose to keep the project private, but far better for it to be public. You can also start this remote repository with a ‘readme’ file, ‘gitignore’ and a license if you want, but in this example we’re going to do these steps locally on our own machine.\nClick the green ‘create repository’ button to continue, which looks like this:\n\nThis sets-up the remote repository on GitHub, but it’s empty right now. We haven’t sent any information yet. This will be the final step of the next section.\nFor now, let’s associate our local repository with the remote repository:\n\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/matt-dray/demo-project.git\n\nRemember to change the file path to match your the URL to your project.\n\n\n\n3. A Git/GitHub workflow\nSo far nothing has been put under version control; we’ve just been doing some set-up steps. Now we’ll create a file structure and start using Git and GitHub.\n\nWork on your files\nStart adding project files to your folder. Let’s say you’ve added a data set in raw-data/data.csv; an analysis.R script to analyse it; and a very important README.md file to to explain what your project is about.\nLet’s say the CSV file contains these data:\nnumber,position,name,nationality\n1,\"GK\",\"Nicky Weaver\",\"England\"\n9,\"FW\",\"Paul Dickov\",\"Scotland\"\n10,\"FW\",\"Shaun Goater\",\"Bermuda\"\n22,\"DF\",\"Richard Dunne\",\"Ireland\"\n29,\"MF\",\"Shaun Wright-Phillips\",\"England\"\n\n\n\nRichard Dunne (Wikimedia Commons, edited).\n\n\nAnd the R script looks like this:\n\nmancity &lt;- read.csv(\"raw-data/data.csv\")  # read data\nmancity[mancity$position == \"FW\", ]  # filter for forwards\n\nAnd the readme file, written here using Markdown, says:\n# demo-project\n\nThis is a demonstration of how to use Git and GitHub. It accompanies a blog post on [rostrum.blog](https://rostrum.blog).\nSo the file tree ends up looking like this:\ndemo-project/\n├── analysis.R\n├── .git\n├── .gitignore\n├── raw-data/\n│   └── data.csv\n└── README.md\nGreat, now let’s capture this version with Git.\n\n\nCheck file status\nRun git status to see the files that have been created or modified.\n\n$ git status\n\n\nOn branch master\n\nNo commits yet\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n    .gitignore\n    README.md\n    analysis.R\n    raw-data/\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\nAll our new files and folders are listed under ‘Untracked files’. By ‘untracked’ Git is telling us that these are new files that haven aren’t yet under version control. All the files will be new the first time you run this process, of course.\nNote that any files that are in your .gitignore will not appear here, since they’ve been ignored.\nHelpfully, the output of git status also tells us what we need to do next: we need to use git add.\n\n\nAdd changes\nNow you need to earmark the files whose changes you want to record. This process is called staging. The stage is a safe place where you can add files to be captured; they’re not yet confirmed. This is a preventative measure so you don’t accidentally record anything you didn’t mean to.\nAs mentioned in the output of git status, we can type git add &lt;file&gt; to do this. We have three files to add, so we can name them all:\n\n$ git add .gitignore README.md analysis.R raw-data/\n\nYou could also use git add ., where the period means ‘all the files’. Be careful if you use this – you don’t want to end up capturing things you didn’t mean to.\nYou won’t get any output, so how do we know this worked? Check the status again.\n\n$ git status\n\n\nOn branch master\n\nNo commits yet\n\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n\n    new file:   .gitignore\n    new file:   README.md\n    new file:   analysis.R\n    new file:   raw-data/data.csv\n\nThese files are now staged and marked as ‘changes to be committed’.\nIf you made a mistake at this point and want to remove files from the stage, you can type git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;. This line is helpfully printed in the output from git status.\n\n\nCommit changes\nWhen you’re happy with the files that have been staged, you can now commit them. This confirms that you want Git to record the changes made to these files.\nYou commit the staged changes using git commit. It’s good practice to leave a message explaining what changes were made and why. You can leave a simple message using the -m flag of git commit2. The message should be short (typically less than 50 characters) but informative (not just ‘changed stuff’). It’s convention to start with a verb, like ‘add this thing’ or ‘fix that thing’.\n\n$ git commit -m \"Add readme, gitignore, script and data\"\n\n\n[master (root-commit) 133733b] Add readme, gitignore, script and data\n 4 files changed, 50 insertions(+)\n create mode 100644 .gitignore\n create mode 100644 README.md\n create mode 100644 analysis.R\n create mode 100644 raw-data/data.csv\n\nThe output confirms the files that have been added. It also tells us how many insertions (characters added) and deletions (characters removed) there were. The create mode lines reference that a file has started to be tracked.\nHow often should you make commits? It’s up to you, but it’s probably a good idea to do it when you’ve completed a section of code that does something useful and that you might want to revert to if there’s a problem later.\nJust to prove that we’re up to date, we can check the status of the repository once more.\n\n$ git status\n\n\nOn branch master\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nCool. Everything’s up to date.\n\n\nAdd and edit files (repeat as necessary)\nContinue to create and edit files, adding and committing them when necessary. For example, let’s add a row to the data set:\n22,\"FWD\",\"George Weah\",\"Liberia\"\n\n\n\nPresident of Liberia, George Weah (Wikimedia Commons, edited).\n\n\nAnd add this line to the bottom of our README file:\nThe data are a selection of [Manchester City Football Club players from the 2000 to 2001 Premier League season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_Manchester_City_F.C._season).\nGiven that we’ve changed our files and want to store this in our Git version history, let’s go through the status-add-commit workflow again. First, let’s check the status of the files:\n\n$ git status\n\n\nOn branch master\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n\n    modified:   README.md\n    modified:   raw-data/data.csv\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\nSo the altered files are now marked as ‘modified’. Let’s add them both; I’ll use the period shortcut to add both without typing their full names:\n\n$ git add .\n\nOne more look at the status to check it’s done what we wanted:\n\n$ git status\n\n\nOn branch master\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use \"git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n\n    modified:   README.md\n    modified:   raw-data/data.csv\n\nAnd now to commit with a message:\n\ngit commit -m \"Add King George to the data, update readme with Wikipedia link\"\n\n\n[master 1359d3f] Add King George to the data, update readme with Wikipedia link\n 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+)\n\nAnd lets check we’re up to date:\n\n$ git status\n\n\nOn branch master\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nBoom. We’re up to date.\nYou can rinse and repeat this edit-status-add-commit to store versions of the files in your repository.\n\n\nPush changes to GitHub\nGreat, you’ve used Git to version control your files. But the commits are stored locally on your machine. How do you send them to GitHub so you have a remote copy of your version history?\nRemember when we set up the GitHub repository for this project earlier on? Now we’re ready to send the version history from our local project folder to this remote repository.\nYou do this by ‘pushing’ the local information to GitHub.\n\ngit push -u origin master\n\n\nCounting objects: 12, done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (12/12), 1.52 KiB | 388.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 12 (delta 3), reused 0 (delta 0)\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (3/3), done.\nTo https://github.com/matt-dray/demo-project.git\n * [new branch]      master -&gt; master\nBranch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.\n\nThe output confirms that the push was successful.\nIf you go now to your repository on GitHub, you’ll see that your files have been added. For example, I would navigate to https://github.com/matt-dray/demo-project (this is a real link to the project used in this post!).\n\nYou can see the files at the top and our README.md has helpfully been rendered by GitHub so that people can see what the repository is all about.\nThere’s lots of stuff you can do from here. For example, click ‘Commits’ above and to the left of the list of your files. You can see each of the commits we made earlier.\n\nYou can do things like explore the repository at any given commit (click the &lt;&gt; button) or if you click the alphanumeric code (a unique code given to each commit) you can see the changes that were made with that commit. In this split view, the left panel is the state of each file before the commit, with changes on the right. Additions are green and start with a +; deletions are red with a — symbol.\n\nSo now you the version history is available remotely and you can easily navigate the changes and explore the various snapshots of your work.\nNow you can continue to work locally on your files and push the changes to GitHub when you’re ready.\n\n\nClone the repo to your machine\nLet’s say you’re on a different machine or a collaborator wants a copy of the GitHub repo. How do you get the files from GitHub onto the new machine?\nYou can ‘clone’ the repo.\nTo do this, we need to tell Git where to clone from. One method is via HTTPS using the repo’s URL:\n\nNavigate to the repo\nClick the ‘clone or download’ button and copy the path\nUse cd on the command line to navigate to where you want to clone the repo\nRun git clone &lt;path&gt;\n\n\n\n\nClick the green button, copy the path\n\n\nYou’ll see something like this when you run git clone from the command line:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/matt-dray/demo-project.git\n\n\nCloning into 'demo-project'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 15, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (15/15), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.\nremote: Total 15 (delta 5), reused 10 (delta 3), pack-reused 0\nUnpacking objects: 100% (15/15), done.\n\nThe output shows the progress of the download. Congratulations, the repo has been copied from GitHub to your machine!"

This involves working on an isolated copy of the repo so you can work safely on new features without fear of ruining the main, or ‘master’ branch of work. If your development is successful, you can merge it back into the ‘master’ branch with a ‘pull request’.\nYou will also want to think about working collaboratively on a project. GitHub has lots of facilities for encouraging team work, like issue tracking and the ability to comment on changes. If you’re working on a new feature in a branch you can request a review from your colleagues to merge your work into the main ‘master’ branch; this is called a ‘pull request’.\nI recommend checking out some of the great materials that are alreay out there. See the next section for some starters."

    "text": "Suppression depression\n{a11ytables} is an R package that lets you generate publishable spreadsheets that follow the UK government’s best practice guidance.\nOne requirement is to replace missing values with placeholder symbols. For example, suppressed data can be replaced with the string \"[c]\" (‘confidential’).\nOf course, R’s behaviour means it can store only one data type per column, so a numeric-type column will be automatically converted to character when you introduce at least one string value (i.e. something in \"quotes\").2\nFor example, this vector is type ‘double’ (i.e. decimals and not ‘whole-number’ integers) and has the more general ‘numeric’ class:\n\nnums &lt;- runif(100)\ntypeof(nums); class(nums)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nThe whole thing is converted to character type if you append just one character value.\n\ntypeof(c(nums, \"[c]\"))\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThis is known behaviour, yes, but it causes a minor annoyance in the xlsx files output from an {a11ytables} workflow: Excel puts a warning marker in the corner of any cell in a text column that contains a numeric value.3\n\nCat left a GitHub issue related to this: columns entirely made of numbers were being marked by Excel with the ‘number in a text column’ warning. In this case, it was because Cat’s suppression process resulted in all columns being converted to character.\nIt would be great to convert back to numeric any columns that did not receive a placeholder symbol during the wrangling process. How can you do this?"

    "text": "Type specimen\nLet’s consider a demo example. First I’ll attach {dplyr}, which is commonly used by stats producers in the UK government.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\n\nHere’s a very simple dataframe, tbl, to use as a demo. Column x contains values that will need to be suppressed because they’re lower than 5. There are no such values in column y.\n\nset.seed(1337)\n\ntbl &lt;- tibble(\n  id = LETTERS[1:5],\n  x  = round(runif(5, 0, 10), 2),\n  y  = round(runif(5, 6, 10), 2)\n)\n\ntbl\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  id        x     y\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A      5.76  7.33\n2 B      5.65  9.79\n3 C      0.74  7.12\n4 D      4.54  6.98\n5 E      3.73  6.58\n\n\nSo, to borrow and simplify Cat’s approach: for each numeric column in tbl (i.e. x and y), replace any value of less than 5 with the placeholder string \"[c]\", otherwise retain the original value.\n\ntbl_supp &lt;- tbl |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    across(\n      where(is.numeric),\n      \\(value) if_else(\n        condition = value &lt; 5, \n        true      = \"[c]\",\n        false     = as.character(value)\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\ntbl_supp\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  id    x     y    \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 A     5.76  7.33 \n2 B     5.65  9.79 \n3 C     [c]   7.12 \n4 D     [c]   6.98 \n5 E     [c]   6.58 \n\n\nSo column x now contains text values and has predictably been converted to character, which you can see as &lt;chr&gt; in the tibble header. But notice that y is also character type despite all the numeric values being retained.\nThis happened because the if_else() we used to create tbl_supp required the true and false arguments to resolve to the same type. The false argument must use as.character() because true resolves to the character value \"[c]\".\nIdeally we’d perform our suppression step but column x would end up as character and y as numeric. How can we achieve this?"

    "text": "Adjust my type\nIn this section are some methods to fix the problem by:\n\nCausing yourself further brainache\nUsing a (relatively little known?) base R function\nDoing it ‘properly’ from the outset\n\n\nType 1: nah\nOf course, we could run tbl_supp |&gt; mutate(y = as.numeric(y)) to convert that specific column back to numeric. But imagine if you have a lot more columns and you can’t be sure which ones need to be converted.\nMaybe you could apply as.numeric() across all columns? Columns of numbers stored as text will then be converted entirely to numeric:\n\nas.numeric(c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"))\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nBut this causes a problem for character columns that contain text, like our placeholder symbol:\n\nas.numeric(c(\"1\", \"[c]\"))\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\n[1]  1 NA\n\n\nSo \"1\" becomes 1, but we’re warned that \"[c]\" has been converted to NA (well, NA_real_, which is the numeric form of NA).\nWe could do something convoluted, like see which columns didn’t gain NA values and should be retained as numeric. But that’s bonkers. This approach ultimately makes things worse because we’ve actually lost information!\nReally we want to check each column to see if it contains numbers only and then convert it to numeric. How?\n\n\nType 2: better\nThere’s a handy base R function that I had forgotten about: type.convert().\nIt takes a vector and, in turn, tries to coerce it to each data type. The process stops when coercion occurs without error. As the help file (?type.convert) puts it:\n\nGiven a vector, the function attempts to convert it to logical, integer, numeric or complex, and when additionally as.is = FALSE… converts a character vector to factor. The first type that can accept all the non-missing values is chosen.\n\nAnd handily:\n\nWhen the data object x is a data frame or list, the function is called recursively for each column or list element.\n\nSo we can pass our entire dataframe to type.convert() and it’ll check them all for us:\n\ntbl_supp_conv &lt;- type.convert(tbl_supp, as.is = TRUE)\n\ntbl_supp_conv\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  id    x         y\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A     5.76   7.33\n2 B     5.65   9.79\n3 C     [c]    7.12\n4 D     [c]    6.98\n5 E     [c]    6.58\n\n\nAs we wanted, our character column y has become numeric type (&lt;dbl&gt;) while x remains as character. Neato.\n\n\nType 3: betterer\nThere are probably better approaches to this problem from the outset, rather than after-the-fact application of type.convert().\nAs Tim has pointed out, you could actually just use the base R form of ifelse():\n\ntbl |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    across(\n      where(is.numeric),\n      \\(value) ifelse(\n        test = value &lt; 5, \n        yes  = \"[c]\",\n        no   = value\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  id    x         y\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A     5.76   7.33\n2 B     5.65   9.79\n3 C     [c]    7.12\n4 D     [c]    6.98\n5 E     [c]    6.58\n\n\nI think people use dplyr::if_else() for (a) consistency if they’re already using tidyverse in the script and (b) it’s ‘strictness’ compared to ifelse(). if_else() will force you to declare the true and false arguments so they resolve to the same type, whereas ifelse() will silently force type coercion, which may be undesirable in some cases.\nAnother method would be to iterate the suppression over only the columns that need it. For example, you could do that with a simple for and if:\n\ncols_numeric &lt;- names(select(tbl, where(is.numeric)))\n\nfor (col in cols_numeric) {\n  if (any(tbl[col] &lt; 5)) {\n    tbl[col] &lt;- ifelse(\n      tbl[col] &lt; 5,\n      \"[c]\",\n      as.character(tbl[[col]])\n    )\n  }\n}\n\ntbl\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  id    x         y\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A     5.76   7.33\n2 B     5.65   9.79\n3 C     [c]    7.12\n4 D     [c]    6.98\n5 E     [c]    6.58\n\n\nThis reads as ‘for each numeric column that contains at least one value less than 5, replace those values with the placeholder symbol \"[c]\".’"

The order is like logical &gt; integer &gt; numeric &gt; character, where the latter are ‘dominant’ to those prior (massive oversimplification). As an aside, this results in some oddities to the untrained eye: sum(2, TRUE) resolves to 3, because TRUE is coerced to the numeric value 1 (FALSE is 0) and so we get 2 + 1 = 3.↩︎\nYou can dismiss these warning markers in the Excel GUI, but I don’t think it’s possible to suppress these markers programmatically and proactively in {a11ytables}. Note also that {a11ytables} cheats a bit here for sake of presentation. The generate_workbook() function guesses that the column was intended to be numeric and adds style information to right-align the values in the output xlsx, which is how numeric values are normally treated in Excel.↩︎\nTurns out there’s literally such a thing as type punning.↩︎"

The points can be layered on top of each other where they take the same Y value and can be stretched arbitrarily along the X axis.\nIf you don’t have too much data, or if you sample it, you can stop the data points in a stripchart from overlapping and instead line them up side by side where they take the same Y value. This is called a ‘beeswarm’. Why? Probably because the cloud of data you’re plotting looks a bit like a swarm of bees.\nBelow is how the plots look side by side.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)     # for plotting\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)  # more on this later\nlibrary(cowplot)     # arrange plots\n\n# Create data set\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  \"variable\" = rep(c(\"runif\", \"rnorm\"), each = 100),\n  \"value\" = c(runif(100, min = -3, max = 3), rnorm(100))\n)\n\n# Generate different plot types\ncanvas &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(variable, value)) \nbox &lt;- canvas + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle(\"Boxplot\")\nviolin &lt;- canvas + geom_violin() + ggtitle(\"Violin\")\nstrip &lt;- canvas + geom_jitter(width = 0.2)  + ggtitle(\"Stripchart\")\nbee &lt;- canvas + geom_quasirandom()  + ggtitle(\"Beeswarm\")\n\n# Arrange plots\ngrid &lt;- plot_grid(box, violin, strip, bee)\n\nprint(grid)"

In this case I’m taking just six colours.\n\n# Generate named vector of 'simple' colours\ncols_vec &lt;- setNames(\n  c(\"#000000\", \"#0000ff\", \"#008000\", \"#ff0000\", \"#ffffff\", \"#ffff00\"),\n  c(\"black\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"red\", \"white\", \"yellow\")\n)\n\nThen we can plot squares of these colours, using image_graph() to read them as magick-class objects.4 My method here is not the most efficient, but you can see the output is an image that contains our six colours.\n\n\nClick for code\n\n\n# For each vector element (colour) create a square of that colour\nfor (i in seq_along(cols_vec)) {\n  fig_name &lt;- paste0(names(cols_vec)[i], \"_square\")  # create object name\n  assign(\n    fig_name,  # set name\n    image_graph(width = 100, height = 100, res = 300)  # create magick object\n  )\n  par(mar = rep(0, 4))  # set plot margins\n  plot.new()  # new graphics frame\n  rect(0, 0, 1, 1, col = cols_vec[i], border = cols_vec[i])  # build rectangle\n  assign(fig_name, magick::image_crop(get(fig_name), \"50x50+10+10\")) # crop\n  dev.off()  # shut down plotting device\n  rm(i, fig_name)  # clear up\n}\n\n# Generate names of the coloured square objects\ncol_square &lt;- paste0(names(cols_vec), \"_square\")\n\n# Combine magick objects (coloured squares)\nsimple_cols &lt;- image_append(c(\n  get(col_square[1]), get(col_square[2]), get(col_square[3]),\n  get(col_square[4]), get(col_square[5]), get(col_square[6])\n))\n\n\n\nprint(simple_cols)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  format width height colorspace matte filesize density\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;lgl&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n1 PNG      300     50 sRGB       TRUE         0 300x300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap to the image\nNow we can apply the simple colour set to the test image using image_map().\n\nduplo_mapped &lt;- image_map(image = duplo, map = simple_cols)\n\nAnd we can use image_animate() to see the difference between the two.\n\nimage_animate(c(duplo, duplo_mapped), fps = 1)\n\n\n\n\nGreat. You can see where the original colours have been replaced by the ‘closest’ simple colours.\nNote in particular where the more reflective surfaces are mapped to white than the actual brick colour.\nThis is okay: the brick may be blue, but we’ve only defined one shade of blue. If a particular shade is closer to white, then so be it.\n\n\n\nQuantify the colours\nNow we can take this mapped image and quantify how much of the image belongs to each colour. Imagine we’ve broken the image into pixels and then we’re counting how many belng to each of our six colours.\n\n# Function to count the colours (adapted from Jeroen Ooms)\ncount_colors &lt;- function(image) {\n  data &lt;- image_data(image) %&gt;%\n    apply(2:3, paste, collapse = \"\") %&gt;% \n    as.vector %&gt;% table() %&gt;%  as.data.frame() %&gt;% \n    setNames(c(\"hex\", \"freq\"))\n  data$hex &lt;- paste(\"#\", data$hex, sep=\"\")\n  return(data)\n}\n\n# Dataframe of dominant colours \nduplo_col_freq &lt;- duplo_mapped %&gt;%\n  count_colors() %&gt;%\n  left_join(\n    enframe(cols_vec) %&gt;% rename(hex = value),\n    by = \"hex\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(freq)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = 100*round((freq/sum(freq)), 3)) %&gt;% \n  select(\n    `Colour name` = name, Hexadecimal = hex,\n    `Frequency of colour` = freq, `Percent of image` = percent\n  )\n\nduplo_mapped  # see mapped image again\n\n\n\nknitr::kable(duplo_col_freq)  # quantify colour\n\n\n\n\nColour name\nHexadecimal\nFrequency of colour\nPercent of image\n\n\n\n\nred\n#ff0000\n132135\n24.5\n\n\nwhite\n#ffffff\n107841\n20.0\n\n\nblack\n#000000\n103645\n19.2\n\n\nyellow\n#ffff00\n79750\n14.8\n\n\ngreen\n#008000\n64868\n12.0\n\n\nblue\n#0000ff\n51761\n9.6\n\n\n\n\n\nSo red makes up almost a quarter of the image, with white and black just behind. This makes sense: many of the bricks are red and much of the shadow areas of yellow bricks were rendered as red, while black and white make up many of the other shadows and reflective surfaces."

The composition is usually ‘accidentally’ pleasing. Sometimes landmarks are captured, like The Shard, The Natural History Museum and V&A and Heathrow.\n\n\n\nThe Shard looks pointy even in 2D.\n\n\nI was wondering whether the bot has ‘found’ other landmarks that I hadn’t noticed or whether it’s found my house. The londonmapbot source code doesn’t have a log file for all the coordinates it’s generated, so I figured the easiest way to get this information and explore it would be to grab all the tweets – which contain the coordinates as text – and then map the results."

What if you need to go back and change something in a post from four years ago?1\nI built a demo {distill} blog to test whether the {renv} package might be a viable solution for reproducibility on a post-by-post basis.\n{renv} is a package by Kevin Ushey that records your dependencies in a text ‘lockfile’. It typically works on the scale of a whole project, but since version 0.13.0 you can have multiple profiles within a given project.\nI think this means that each post can have its own profile with its own distinct set of packages and package versions.\nThat means you can easily recreate a specific environment for a given post at a given time if you need to alter and re-render it in future."

You can follow the guidance from RStudio, but basically:\n\nCreate your blog with distill::create_blog()\nBuild it with rmarkdown::render_site() (or ‘Build Website’ from the Build pane of RStudio)\nInitiate a reproducible environment for the blog as a whole with renv::init()\n\nAnd then a new-post workflow could look like this:\n\nCreate a new post with distill_create_post()\nActivate a profile for the new post with renv::activate(), providing a unique name to the profile argument (I suggest the post’s folder name as seen in the blog’s _posts/ folder)\nInstall the packages you need for the post with renv::install()\nCapture the dependencies in the profile’s lockfile with renv::snapshot()\n\nIn code, that might look a bit like this:\n\ndistill::create_post(\"new-post\")\n\nrenv::activate(profile = \"YYYY-MM-DD-new-post\")\n\nrenv::install(\n  \"distill\",\n  \"rmarkdown\",\n  \"palmerpenguins\",\n  \"dplyr\"\n)\n\nrenv::snapshot()\n\nFor the demo blog, I called the two profiles ‘2022-03-14-dplyr-085’ and ‘2022-03-14-dplyr-108’, which you can see in the renv/profiles/ folder of the project repo.\nThese are named uniquely for the two separate folders in the _posts/ directory that contain each post’s files. This naming structure should make it easy to remember the profile associated with each post.\nAs I worked on the posts, I switched between the two profiles with renv::activate(), passing the relevant profile name to the profile argument.\nNote that passing NULL as the profile argument means you switch to the default profile associated with the project as a whole, i.e. when you ran renv::init()."

Maybe.\nI’d be interested to hear other criticisms, especially before I try and use this approach for real.\nMeanwhile, I know that Danielle Navarro has approached this with a more thought-out and sophisticated approach and has created a work-in-progress package called {refinery} to help build a separate environment for each post in a {distill} blog.\nIn general, Danielle’s blog does a brilliant job of explaining the problem of blog reproducibility and the technicals behind it.

    "text": "Prepare a scanner probe\nWe could extract episode names from the scripts, but another option is to scrape them from the ST:TNG episode guide on Wikipedia.\nIf you visit that link, you’ll notice that the tables of episodes actually give a stardate, but they only provide one per episode – our script-scraping shows that many episodes have multiple instances of stardates.\nWe can use the {rvest} package by Hadley Wickham to perform the scrape. This works by supplying a website address and the path of the thing we want to extract – the episode name column of tables on the Wikipedia page. I used SelectorGadget – a point-and-click tool for finding the CSS selectors for elements of webpages – for this column in each of the tables on the Wikipedia page (.wikiepisodetable tr &gt; :nth-child(3)). A short how-to vignette is available for {rvest} + SelectorGadget.\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\n# store website address\ntng_ep_wiki &lt;- read_html(\n  \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_episodes\"\n)\n\n# extract and tidy\ntng_ep_names &lt;- tng_ep_wiki %&gt;%  # website address\n  html_nodes(\".wikiepisodetable tr &gt; :nth-child(3)\") %&gt;%  # via SelectorGadget\n  html_text() %&gt;%  # extract text\n  tibble() %&gt;%  # to dataframe\n  rename(episode_title = \".\") %&gt;%  # sensible column name\n  filter(episode_title != \"Title\") %&gt;%  # remove table headers\n  mutate(episode = row_number() + 101)  # episode number (join key)\n\nhead(tng_ep_names)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  episode_title                      episode\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 \"\\\"Encounter at Farpoint\\\"\"            102\n2 \"\\\"The Naked Now\\\"\"                    103\n3 \"\\\"Code of Honor\\\"\"                    104\n4 \"\\\"The Last Outpost\\\"\"                 105\n5 \"\\\"Where No One Has Gone Before\\\"\"     106\n6 \"\\\"Lonely Among Us\\\"\"                  107\n\n\nSo now we can join the episode names to the dataframe generated from the scripts. This gives us a table with a row per stardate extracted, with its associated season, episode number and episode name.\n\nstardate_tidy_names &lt;- stardate_tidy_plus %&gt;%\n  left_join(tng_ep_names, by = \"episode\") %&gt;% \n  select(season, episode, episode_title, stardate, stardate_decimal)\n\nWe can make these data into an interactive table with the DT::datatable() htmlwidget.\n\nlibrary(DT)\n\ndatatable(\n  stardate_tidy_names,\n  rownames = FALSE,\n  options = list(pageLength = 5, autoWidth = TRUE)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s a searchable list of all the stardates in each episode."

    "text": "Ce n’est pas une probleme?\nI’ve gathered the solutions into three categories (click to jump):\n\nSummary inspection\n\n\n{tidylog}\n{ViewPipeSteps}\n\n\nDebug mode\n\n\n{tamper}\n{pipecleaner}\n{magrittr}\ndebug()\n\n\nOperator hacking\n\n\n{pipes}\nBizarro pipe\n\n\n1. Summary inspection\nThese are packages for seeing what happened to your data set at each step of your pipeline, rather than highlighting where the problem was.\n\n1a. {tidylog}\nThe {tidylog} package by Benjamin Elbers prints to the console some summary sentences of the changes that have happened to your data after each pipe step. You can install it from CRAN:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidylog\")\n\nMake sure you attach it after {dplyr}.\n\nlibrary(tidylog)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'tidylog'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    add_count, add_tally, anti_join, count, distinct, distinct_all,\n    distinct_at, distinct_if, filter, filter_all, filter_at, filter_if,\n    full_join, group_by, group_by_all, group_by_at, group_by_if,\n    inner_join, left_join, mutate, mutate_all, mutate_at, mutate_if,\n    relocate, rename, rename_all, rename_at, rename_if, rename_with,\n    right_join, sample_frac, sample_n, select, select_all, select_at,\n    select_if, semi_join, slice, slice_head, slice_max, slice_min,\n    slice_sample, slice_tail, summarise, summarise_all, summarise_at,\n    summarise_if, summarize, summarize_all, summarize_at, summarize_if,\n    tally, top_frac, top_n, transmute, transmute_all, transmute_at,\n    transmute_if, ungroup\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter\n\n\nYou can see from the output that {tidylog} masks all the {dplyr} functions. In other words, you can continue use the {dplyr} function names as usual, but {tidylog} will add a side-effect: it will print in English a summary of the changes.\n\npeng_pipe &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(species) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_length = round(mean_length))\n\nfilter: removed 124 rows (36%), 220 rows remaining\n\n\ngroup_by: one grouping variable (species)\n\n\nsummarise: now 2 rows and 2 columns, ungrouped\n\n\nmutate: changed 2 values (100%) of 'mean_length' (0 new NA)\n\n\nThis a nice passive approach. But how does this help? We can sense-check each step. For example:\n\npeng_pipe &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Cycliophora\", \"Onychophora\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(species) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_length = round(mean_length))\n\nfilter: removed all rows (100%)\n\n\ngroup_by: one grouping variable (species)\n\n\nsummarise: now 0 rows and 2 columns, ungrouped\n\n\nmutate: no changes\n\n\nDid you spot the extremely contrived error? I filtered for species that don’t exist in the data set1. This was reported as filter: removed all rows (100%) in the first step.\nI’ll unload {tidylog} before continuing so it doesn’t interfere with the other examples.\n\nunloadNamespace(\"tidylog\")\n\n\n\n1b. {ViewPipeSteps}\nThe {ViewPipeSteps} package by David Ranzolin is an RStudio Addin available from GitHub. Basically it lets you View() or print() at each step of your pipeline so you can see what’s happened to the the data set.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"daranzolin/ViewPipeSteps\")\nlibrary(ViewPipeSteps)\n\nAfter installing you can simply highlight your code and select ‘View Pipe Chain Steps’ or ‘Print Pipe Chain Steps’ from the RStudio Addins menu.\nBeware if you have lots of steps in your pipeline because it’s going to fill up your console, or a whole bunch of RStudio tabs or windows containing each cut of the data set.\n\n\n\n2. Debug mode\nThese are packages that help highlight where a problem occurred. These take you to the debug menu, which is worth reading up on if you haven’t used it before.\n\n2a. {tamper}\nGábor Csárdi’s {tamper} package makes pipe debugging easier with a simple, informative interface. The package is currently available on GitHub but is archived.\nYou set the error argument of options() to tamper once installed and loaded. From now on {tamper} will override the default stack trace report you get when an error is found. Here I’ve used a column that doesn’t exist in the data set:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"gaborcsardi/tamper\")\noptions(error = tamper::tamper)\n\npenguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(species) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_length = mean(bill_girth, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%  # error here!\n  mutate(mean_length = round(mean_length))\n\nWhen there’s an error, {tamper} highlights the problematic line with an arrow. Typing ‘0’ will exit the {tamper} report; ‘1’ switches you back to the stack trace; ‘2’ will enter debug mode. Here’s how that looks in the console at first:\n## Error in mean(Sepal.Girth) : object 'Sepal.Girth' not found\n## \n## Enter 0 to exit or choose:\n## \n## 1:    Switch mode\n## 2:    Take me to the error\n## \n## 3:    penguins %&gt;%\n## 4: -&gt;   filter(., Species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;%\n## 5:      group_by(., species) %&gt;%\n## 6:      summarise(., mean_length = mean(bill_girth, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n## 7:      mutate(., mean_length = round(mean_length))\n## \n## Selection:\n\n\n2b. {pipecleaner}\nThe {pipecleaner} package by Edward Visel is another RStudio Addin available on GitHub. It has the best name.\nYou highlight your code and select ‘debug pipeline in browser’ from the RStudio Addins menu. This ‘bursts’ your pipeline to one intermediate object per function call, then opens the debug menu. You can also simply ‘burst pipes’ from the Addins menu without debug mode.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"alistaire47/pipecleaner\")\nlibrary(pipecleaner)\n\n# Intact, original pipeline\npeng_pipe &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(species) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_length = round(mean_length))\n\n# Highlight the original pipeline and select 'debug pipeline in browser' or \n# 'burst pipes' from the RStudio Addins menu\ndot1 &lt;- filter(penguins, species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\"))\ndot2 &lt;- group_by(dot1, species)\ndot3 &lt;- summarise(dot2, mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))\npeng_pipe &lt;- mutate(dot3, mean_length = round(mean_length))\n\nSo effectively it steps through each new object to report back errors. But it leaves you with multiple objects (with meaningless names) to clean up; there’s no ‘fix pipes’ option to return to your original pipeline.\n\n\n2c. {magrittr}\nSurprise: the {magrittr} package itself has the function debug_pipe() to let you see what’s being passed into the next function.\n\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\npeng_pipe &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(species) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  debug_pipe() %&gt;%\n  mutate(mean_length = round(mean_length))\n\nNot much to say about this one, but worth mentioning because %&gt;% gets re-exported in other packages2 but debug_pipe() doesn’t.\n\n\n2d. debug()\nYou can simply use R’s debug() function, as pointed out by Nathan Werth.\nYou can do this for a given function in the pipeline:\n\ndebug(summarise)\n\npeng_pipe &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(species) %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_length = round(mean_length))\n\nundebug(summarise)\n\nOr you can even debug each step by setting up debug(`%&gt;%`), since the pipe is itself a function, after all.\n\n\n\n3. Operator hacking\nIt’s possible to make variant pipe operators. Maybe we don’t even need %&gt;%?\n\n3a. {pipes}\nAntoine Fabri forked the {magrittr} GitHub repo to add a bunch of %&gt;% variants that have side properties. These are available from his {pipes} package.\nA few of direct relevance to this discussion:\n\n%P&gt;% to print() the data set to the console\n%V&gt;% will View() the full data set\n%D&gt;% opens with debug menu\n\nOthers apply different functions during the piping step. There’s some nice ones for summaries, like %glimpse&gt;% and %skim&gt;%.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"moodymudskipper/pipes\")\nlibrary(pipes)\n\nAttaching package: 'pipes'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    %&gt;%\nHere’s an example of %P&gt;% that pipes forward into the next function and prints it to console.\n\npeng_pipe &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  filter(species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(species) %P&gt;%  # note %P&gt;% operator \n  summarise(mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(mean_length = round(mean_length))\n\nsummarise(., mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  species   mean_length\n  &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie           38.8\n2 Chinstrap        48.8\nNoe that the final output of the chain is assigned to peng_pipe. We’re seeing the printed output of the summarise() step without the following mutate() step, given where we placed the %P&gt;% operator.\nSo this one could have gone in the ‘summary inspection’ section above, but it contains more functions than for printing and viewing alone.\n\n\n3b. Bizarro pipe\nForget installing a package to get the pipe. We can create an operator that acts like a pipe but can be run so that we can check what’s happening at each step.\nJohn Mount’s solution is the ‘Bizarro pipe’, which looks like -&gt;.;. This is a simple hack that’s legitimate base R code. The -&gt;.; operator reads as ‘right-assign the left-hand side to a period and then perform the next operation’.\nThings you might be wondering:\n\nyes, you can use a -&gt; for assignment to the right\nyes, you can assign to ., but you’ll need to explicitly supply it as the data argument to the next function call in your Bizarro pipeline\nyes, you can use semi-colons in R for run-on code execution, try head(penguins); tail(penguins)\n\nThis means you can execute each line in turn and check the output. But wait: an object called . is not presented in the global environment. Not unless you check ‘Show .Last.value in environment listing’ in RStudio’s settings. Now when you run the line you’ll see the ‘.Last.value’ that’s been output.\n\npenguins -&gt;.;\nfilter(., species %in% c(\"Adelie\", \"Chinstrap\")) -&gt;.;\ngroup_by(., species) -&gt;.;\nsummarise(., mean_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) -&gt;.;\nmutate(., mean_length = round(mean_length)) -&gt; peng_pipe\n\nNote that the name of the object comes at the end; we’re always passing the object to the right.\nThis might confuse your colleagues, but hey, no dependencies are needed!"

    "text": "Minigames\nI thought I’d try out with {keypress} with three tiny interactive games, which I’ve bundled into a pico package2 called {hokey}.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/hokey\")\n\nEach one takes a keypress input from keypress::keypress() to affect the game, which is just a bunch of if or while statements, basically. You can see the functions in the {hokey} package itself, if you’re a nerd.3\nThe games in order of complexity:\n\ntype(), a test of typing skills\nadventure(), a 2D side-scrollling adventure\nbattle(), a clicker-style monster smasher\n\nThese aren’t properly documented ot tested or anything. They’re just for demo’s sake.\nThe rest of this post describes the games with a dash of dry humour.\n\n1. Typing test\nHow fast you can you type randomly-selected letters?\nIn the type() game a countdown will begin and then you’ll be prompted to type one letter at a time, the total number of which can be controlled with the n argument.\nHere’s what a completed game might look like, where each letter is revealed sequentially after typing the previous one.\n\nhokey::type(n = 5)\n\n3... 2... 1... Go!\nPress 'r'! Hit!\nPress 'o'! Hit!\nPress 'f'! Hit!\nPress 'l'! 'h'? Miss!\nPress 'z'! Hit!\nEnd! 4/5 in 5.403 seconds.\nYes, three decimal places in the elapsed time so that people can be more easily ranked on speedruns.com.\n\n\n2. An adventure\nYou’ve played 2D games (e.g. Mario). You’ve played 2.5D games (e.g. Mario). You’ve played 3D games (e.g. Mario).\nYou’re thinking the future is four-dimensional Mario. But you’re wrong.\nInstead, hokey::adventure() explores the full power of moving along a one-dimensional line.\nTake control of the hero. Which is a dot. Move around the overworld. Which is a line. Simulate the lustrous points of Lineland from Edwin A Abbott’s Flatland!\n\nhokey::adventure(len = 10)\n\nPress left/right arrow keys\n--.------- \nBelow is a demo of what happens if you start the game and travel to the dangerous lands of the west (two left-key presses, resulting in you being bumped back on course), before heading for the utopian kingdom in the east (multiple right-key presses).\nThe symbol to the right of the line explains what’s happened (&lt; is left, &gt; is right, x is an illegal move, ! is a win).\nPress left/right arrow keys\n--.------- \n-.-------- &lt; \n.--------- x \n-.-------- &gt; \n--.------- &gt; \n---.------ &gt; \n----.----- &gt; \n-----.---- &gt; \n------.--- &gt; \n-------.-- &gt; \n--------.- &gt; \n---------. ! \nSuch graphics! Such dimensions!\n\n\n3. A clicker\nEver heard of Cookie Clicker? It’s a game where you click. A cookie. A whole bunch of times. Like, seriously, a whole bunch of times. Why? To win, of course.\nHere instead is a ‘presser’, where where you tap keys to vanquish randomised foes. Are there upgrades? No. Are there cool sprites? Not really. But do you click a lot? Also no, but you get to press buttons a lot.\nSo, initiate a battle with hokey::battle() and you’re faced with monstrous foes, who have terrifying randomised faces made of letters and symbols.\n\nhokey::battle(n = 3)\n\nNEW FOE! { O _ O } 10 HP \nSmash a key (I recommend Enter because of its large surface area) to deplete the foe’s hit points (HP) until they’re defeated. Each hit is printed as a period.\nNEW FOE! { O _ O } 10 HP \n..........\nVICTORY! { x _ x }  0 HP\nIncrementally more powerful foes will appear!\nNEW FOE! | - o - | 20 HP \n....................\nVICTORY! | x o x |  0 HP\n\nNEW FOE! [ ' v ' ] 30 HP \n..............................\nVICTORY! [ x v x ]  0 HP\nYou know they’re beaten because their eyes become crosses."

    "text": "When in doubt, make a package\nAnd so the {bd2q} R package5 is available from GitHub. It does what I need it to do for now, but note it only has basic error checking, has no unit tests, etc. Use at own risk, etc. It’s likely to remain unpolished forever, but feel free to add issues or pull requests. To install:\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/bd2q\")\n\nThree things were in scope for this package:\n\nCreate a template Quarto blog.\nCreate the necessary Quarto folder structure for posts, then transfer posts and resources from the old {blogdown} blog.\nTweak the posts to remove or replace selected lines.\n\n\n1. Quarto blog template\nI assume someone has already written a version of usethis::create_project() for creating a Quarto blog. Regardless, I’ve written bd2q::create_template() to generate a folder with the minimal structure required, which makes my life easier for testing purposes.\n\nbd2q::create_template(q_path = \"~/new-quarto-blog\")\n\n✔ Created template Quarto blog at /Users/mattdray/new-quarto-blog\nThe skeleton content is opinionated and differs a bit to the one generated through RStudio’s ‘new project’ menu, for example, but the structure is the same:\nblog\n├── about.qmd\n├── index.qmd\n├── posts/\n│   └── metadata.yml\n├── styles.css\n└── blog.rproj\nOf course, now we need to pull in the posts from the old {blogdown} blog.\n\n\n2. Transfer posts and resources\nTypically in a {blogdown} blog, all R Markdown posts and their rendered HTML files are stored together in content/post/ in the form YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.Rmd and YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.html. Resources, like images, live separately in static/post/ with a folder per post in the form YYYY-MM-DD-post-name_files/.\nHere’s a simplified folder structure that focuses on a single post and its resources:\nblog/\n├── content/\n│   └── post/\n│       ├── YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.Rmd\n│       └── YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.html\n└── static/\n    └── post/\n        └── YYYY-MM-DD-post-name_files/\n            └── image.png\nQuarto simplifies this structure. Each post gets its own folder in posts/, like YYYY-MM-DD-post-name, which contains the post as index.qmd and a folder of resources. This means the post and all its content are stored together in one containing folder.\nblog/\n└── posts/\n    └── YYYY-MM-DD-post-name/\n        ├── index.qmd\n        └── resources/\n            └── image.png\nTo do the conversion, bd2q::transfer_posts() copies posts from a {blogdown} blog structure to a Quarto blog structure, setting up the required folders and renaming each post to index.qmd.\n\ntransfer_posts(\n  bd_path = \"~/old-blogdown-blog\",\n  q_path = \"~/new-quarto-blog\"\n)\n\n✔ Created posts/ directory structure.\nℹ Copying posts.\n✔ Copied 148 posts to /Users/mattdray/new-quarto-blog.\nOnce that’s been run, bd2q::transfer_resources() can copy each post’s resources into an accompanying subfolder, which defaults to the name ‘resources’. You can choose which file types you want transfer with the exts_keep argument.\n\ntransfer_resources(\n  bd_path = \"~/old-blogdown-blog\",\n  q_path = \"~/new-quarto-blog\",\n  resources_dir = \"resources\",\n  exts_keep = c(\"gif\", \"jpg\", \"jpeg\", \"png\", \"svg\", \"wav\"),\n)\n\nℹ Copying resources.\n✔ Copied 455 resources to each post's resources/ folder in Users/mattdray/new-quarto-blog/posts.\nOf course this doesn’t account for everything, like bits of JavaScript and CSS related to the use of htmlwidgets. I’m not really bothered about this, because these should be recreated when I re-render each post.\nNote that you can use bd2q::create_and_transfer() if you want to run create_template(), transfer_posts() and transfer_resources() all at once. Regardless, once you’ve got the structure sorted, you can begin to adjust the posts if you need to.\n\n\n3. Tweak post content\nThere’s content in the body of each post that I want to get rid of or make more Quarto-like. I made a few functions that iterate over all the index.qmd files and replace or remove certain content.\nOne obvious necessity is to rebuild the resource paths (to images, sound files, etc), which can be done specifically with bd2q::update_resource_paths(). It defaults to creating paths to each post’s ‘resources’ subfolder, as generated by bd2q::transfer_resources(). For example, you could use a regular expression to match rows you know will contain a resource path and have them updated for the new Quarto folder structure (I tend to insert images with HTML rather than Markdown, hence the &lt;img&gt; tag in the example below).\n\nupdate_resource_paths(\n  q_path = \"~/new-quarto-blog\",\n  resources_dir = \"resources\",\n  resource_rx = \"&lt;img src=\"\n)\n\nℹ Updating posts.\n✔ 148 posts updated.  \nI also added two replace/remove functions that are a little more generic.\nThe first is bd2q::remove_line(), which deletes a single line from each post based on a provided regular expression. When I was messing around with converting the blog to Quarto manually, I found that the presence of the ‘draft’ status in the YAML header would prevent the post from appearing on the homepage, even if was set to ‘no’. As a result, you can run something like this to find and remove the lines that start with ‘draft’:\n\nbd2q::remove_line(\n  q_path = \"~/new-quarto-blog\",\n  detect_rx = \"^draft:\"\n)\n\nℹ Making corrections.\n✔ Removed lines matching the regular expression '^draft:' from 128 out of 148 posts.\nThat’s fine for individual lines, but what if you have a sequence of consecutive lines that you want to find and remove, or replace with some other text?\nThat’s what bd2q::replace_lines() does. Provide a vector of strings that exactly match some consecutive lines in each post, then provide a vector of strings to replace them with (or NULL to simply remove them)6.\nThis addresses another specific problem I was having. I wanted to update my custom session-info blocks at the bottom of each post so that they instead appear as a Quarto ‘appendix’. That can be done like this:\n\nold_lines &lt;- c(\n  \"---\",\n  \"&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Session info&lt;/summary&gt;\",\n  \"```{r eval=TRUE, sessioninfo, echo=FALSE}\",\n  \"sessioninfo::session_info()\",\n  \"```\",\n  \"&lt;/details&gt;\"\n)\n\nnew_lines &lt;- c(\n  \"## Details {.appendix}\",\n  \"&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Session info&lt;/summary&gt;\",\n  \"```{r}\",\n  \"#' eval = TRUE,\",\n  \"#' echo = FALSE\",\n  'cat(\"Date:\", cat(format(Sys.time(), format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")), \"\\n\\n\"); sessionInfo()',\n  \"```\"\n)\n\nbd2q::replace_lines(\n  q_path = \"~/new-quarto-blog\",\n  match_str = old_lines,\n  replacement_str = new_lines\n)\n\nℹ Making corrections.\n✔ Removed lines matching the provided string vector from 9 out of 148 posts.   \nHaha, uhoh, I was expecting to have fixed more posts than that! Looks like I might have written my custom session-info block slightly differently in each post (maybe an extra space or empty line?), so I’ll have to run the bd2q::replace_lines() multiple times to make sure I can replace it in each post that it appears."

Yeah?\nOf course, transferring files into a new structure is the easy part. The hard part is to see if each post will still re-render after all these years. It’s unlikely! There’s no dependency management in this blog because there was no easy easy to do it. Quarto, meanwhile, has the ability to ‘freeze’ posts and link each post to a {renv} lockfile (thanks Albert) that captures each post’s package dependencies.\nThere are some other dependencies outside of packages though. For example, I have posts that use the {rtweet} package to fetch tweets from Twitter, but Twitter is a garbage fire and I may never be able to fetch tweets from the API in future. I may have to just copy-paste the outputs that were created when the post was originally rendered, oh well.\nTo be clear: this is hard work. I may not be brave enough to do it any time soon. I’ve set up a GitHub repo for ‘rostrum-blog-2’ where I’ve been experimenting with styles and structure, so if I ever get round to this task then that’s where the fireworks will be happening.\nAnd hey, at worst I got more familiar with the {fs} and {cli} packages when making {bd2q}, which are for ‘tidy’ path handling and nice user interfaces. A convoluted way to learn!\nBut that’s what this blog is all about, amirite."

Seemed like a neat pun at the time, but the joke is kinda lost on an audience that’s no longer comprised mostly of entomologists. But the audience is mostly me, so I can live with it.↩︎\nAlthough I did use it to investigate a method with {renv} for managing dependencies on a post-by-post basis.↩︎\nIn particular, {blogdown} depends on Hugo, a ‘framework for building websites’.

Which is a boring name, I know.↩︎\nThis was actually more painful than I was hoping. There’s no easy way to match consecutive strings between vectors. In other words, try to extract the sequence c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), in that order, from the vector c(\"a\", \"b\", \"d\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"). Surely there’s an R function that will do this? Anyway, I fudged it by collapsing all the lines of a post into a single string and then finding the matching (collapsed) string provided by the user. Of course, the string will have to be ‘uncollapsed’ to get a string per line, so you can use paste() with a string provide to the collapse argument. But this separator will need to be a string that doesn’t appear in any of your posts, otherwise the uncollapsing process will break a line that you didn’t intend to be broken! I went with /// by default, but the user can change this with the collapse_str argument in bd2q::replace_lines(). Sheesh.↩︎"

I’ve used line breaks to make it easier to create and edit the vector manually.\nHere’s the vector that represents the logo:\n\nlogo_v &lt;- c(\n  \n  0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,\n  \n  0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,\n  \n  0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,\n  0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,\n  \n  0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,\n  0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\n)\n\nI might as well make a (non-generic) function to matrixify (definitely a word) and plot the vector, so I can then tweak a few parameters as I please.\n\nplot_logo &lt;- function(\n  x = logo_v,           # vector\n  px = 16,              # width/length of output (square)\n  col_0 = \"black\",      # colour for values of 0\n  col_1 = \"#1e8016\",    # colour for values of 1\n  lwd = 8               # to separate the squares\n) {\n  \n  par(mar = rep(0, 4))  # set margins outside plot region\n  \n  m &lt;- matrix(x, px)    # create a matrix from the vector\n  m &lt;- m[, ncol(m):1]   # reverse cols\n  \n  image(m, col = c(col_0, col_1))  # plot matrix, colour by number\n  \n  # If line width provided, draw lines between squares\n  if (!is.null(lwd)) {\n    px_half &lt;- px * 2\n    s &lt;- seq(-1 / px_half, 1 + (1 / px_half), 1 / (px - 1))\n    abline(h = s, v = s, col = col_0, lwd = lwd)\n  }\n  \n}\n\nNote that I added a line width argument (lwd). If specified, horizontal and vertical lines are drawn to give the impression that the squares are ‘separated’ from each other.\nHere’s the logo.\n\nplot_logo(lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s what happens if we remove the lines and swap the colours, for example.\n\nplot_logo(col_0 = \"#1e8016\", col_1 = \"black\", lwd = NULL)\n\n\n\n\nAnd given it’s Pride Month:\n\nfor (i in rainbow(7)) {\n  plot_logo(lwd = 1, col_0 = \"white\", col_1 = i)\n}"

    "text": "Sprite delight\nThis approach is basically pixel-art-by-numbers, right?\nSo I’ve written and animated two frames of a classic videogame character, Link from The Legend of Zelda on the NES, using the {magick} package to create a gif.\nThere’s four colours in this one, so the vectors are no longer binary: there’s 0 for the background, 1 for green, 2 for skin and 3 for the darker spots.\nThe top part of the sprite doesn’t change between frames, but the bottom does. To avoid repetition, we can store the top part as a separate vector, then combine it with each frame’s lower section. It’s still a bit of a slog to input these by hand!\n\nlink_v_top &lt;- c(\n  0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,2,0,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,0,2,0,0,\n  0,0,2,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,2,0,0,\n  \n  0,0,2,2,3,2,1,2,2,1,2,3,2,2,0,0,\n  0,0,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,0,0,\n  0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,0,0\n)\n\nlink_v_b1 &lt;- c(\n  0,0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,2,2,1,1,3,0,0,\n  \n  0,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,3,0,\n  3,3,2,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,0,\n  3,2,2,2,3,3,2,3,3,1,1,2,2,2,3,0,\n  3,3,2,3,3,3,2,1,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,0,\n  \n  3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,\n  3,3,3,3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,\n  0,2,2,2,2,2,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n)\n\nlink_v_b2 &lt;- c(\n  0,0,0,0,1,2,2,3,3,2,2,1,3,3,0,0,\n  \n  0,0,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,0,0,\n  0,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,\n  0,3,2,2,2,3,3,2,3,3,1,1,3,0,0,0,\n  0,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,1,3,3,3,1,0,0,0,\n  \n  0,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,1,1,1,0,0,0,\n  0,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,1,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,\n  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n)\n\n# Combine vectors to get frames\nlink_f1 &lt;- c(link_v_top, link_v_b1)\nlink_f2 &lt;- c(link_v_top, link_v_b2)\n\nNow we have the vectors representing Link for each frame of the animation. The approach now is like before: convert this to a 16 by 16 matrix and plot it. This time I’ve got a function that also saves the plots by first opening a png() graphics device and closing it at the end with dev.off(). I’ve saved these to a temporary directory for the purposes of the post, rather than my local disk.\n\ntmp &lt;- tempdir()  # store temporary folder path\n\n# Function to write frame to temporary folder\nwrite_link &lt;- function(vec) {\n  write_path &lt;- file.path(tmp, paste0(substitute(vec), \".png\"))\n  png(write_path, width = 160, height = 160)\n  link_m &lt;- matrix(vec, 16)\n  link_m &lt;- link_m[, ncol(link_m):1]\n  par(mar = rep(0, 4))\n  link_cols &lt;- c(\"white\", \"#7bc702\", \"#cc8f2d\", \"#6c430a\")\n  image(link_m, col = link_cols)\n  dev.off()\n}\n\n# Write the frames\nwrite_link(link_f1); write_link(link_f2)\n\nquartz_off_screen \n                2 \n\n\nquartz_off_screen \n                2 \n\n\nWe get a couple of messages to say that the devices have been closed, confirming the save.\nNow we can use the {magick} package to create a gif: image_read() to load both PNG frames into a single object from their save location, and then image_animate() to combine the images into an output that flips between the two frames. You could also use image_write() to save this object to gif format.\n\n# Generate a gif from the saved frames\npng_paths &lt;- list.files(tmp, \"*.png$\", full.names = TRUE)     # get file paths\nframes &lt;- magick::image_read(png_paths)                       # load the files\nmagick::image_animate(frames, fps = 2, dispose = \"previous\")  # combine frames\n\n\n\n\nI’m not sure I’ll be coding the graphics for the whole game anytime soon…"

And that’s exactly why this post exists.\nLet me know if you know of any more packages or whatever that do this sort of thing.\n\n Note\nTurns out that mikefc, aka coolbutuseless, (who else?) wrote a great blog post with a method for grabbing, plotting and animating sprites with the packages {png}, {raster}, {ggplot2} and {gganimate}. Slightly less painful than writing vectors by hand!\nIf you want to design your own sprites rather than copy others, try my little {pixeltrix} package for interactive pixel selection from a plot window, which returns a matrix."

It is:\n\nan entry into the tidyverse that provides a tidy framework for all things relational (networks/graphs, trees, etc)\n\nTo use the package, we need every host combination4 for each podcast, which can be achieved with the combn() function. This gives us a pair of points (‘nodes’ in graph-speak) that can be connected by a line (an ‘edge’) to indicate their relationship.\nBut a show with one host doesn’t have a pair of points, so I’m going to duplicate these rows first. If we don’t do this, we can’t plot these shows because they won’t have a connection between two nodes.\n\n# Isolate the shows with one host \nsolo_vec &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;%\n  count(Podcast) %&gt;%\n  filter(n == 1) %&gt;%\n  pull(Podcast)\n\n# Filter the show-host dataframe by solo-hosted podcasts\nsolo_df &lt;- filter(shows_clean, Podcast %in% solo_vec)\n\nNow we can bind these rows to the data and then get our host combinations.

Hackett\n\n\n\nWe can turn this data frame of host-pair combinations into a tidygraph object with the as_tbl_graph() function. This class of object contains two data frames (the nodes and the edges) and some metadata.\nWe can also use functions from the {tidygraph}package to help calculate various network statistics. For example, the centrality_degree() function tells us the nodes with the most connections. We can add this as a column in our node data and use this later to do things like resize nodes depending on their centrality.\nYou can manipulate the nodes and edges data frames in this tidygraph object by using the activate() function to switch between them. Currently the node data are active (it says ‘active’ above the nodes data frame), so our application of centrality_degree() to the network object will affect the node data specifically.\n\nrelay_graph &lt;- as_tbl_graph(relay_combos, directed = FALSE)%&gt;% \n  mutate(connections = centrality_degree()) %&gt;%  # number of connections\n  arrange(desc(connections))  # order by number of shows\n\nprint(relay_graph)  \n\n# A tbl_graph: 38 nodes and 64 edges\n#\n# An undirected multigraph with 8 components\n#\n# Node Data: 38 x 2 (active)\n  name               connections\n  &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Myke Hurley                 21\n2 Stephen M.

You can see we have about 38 nodes and 64 edges and that the network is undirected (nodes don’t ‘point’ to each other). We also have eight ‘components’, which are the isolated groups of nodes that connect to each other, but not to other groups."

    "text": "Visualisation\n\nStatic with {ggraph}\nThe {ggraph} package was designed to work seamlessly with {tidygraph}objects and the {ggplot2} plotting package. You simply pass your {tidygraph}object to {ggraph}‘s ’graph’ argument. Below are a couple of examples for demonstration purposes that show you just a handful of options. You can learn more about {ggraph}’s layouts, nodes and edges in a series of blog posts from Thomas Lin Pedersen. This example arranges the nodes (hosts) circularly (plot A) and a straight line (B) and sizes them by the number of connections to other hosts. Each line (edge) represents a co-hosting relationship.\n\ng1 &lt;- ggraph(\n  graph = relay_graph,\n  layout = \"linear\",\n  circular = TRUE\n) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +\n  geom_edge_arc() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\ng2 &lt;- ggraph(\n  graph = relay_graph,\n  layout = \"linear\"\n) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +\n  geom_edge_arc() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nplot_grid(g1, g2, labels = c(\"A\", \"B\"))\n\n\nThis example arranges the nodes (hosts) according to an algorithm specified by the layout argument to ggraph() and sizes them by the number of connections to other hosts. Each line (edge) represents a co-hosting relationship and multiple connections are shown separately by ‘fanning’ them out (hence the geom_edge_fan()).\n\nggraph(graph = relay_graph, layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +\n  geom_edge_fan() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\nI haven’t added labels on the nodes nor the points because of the visual clutter it creates for this particular example. You could use geom_node_text() to add node labels and something like aes(label = &lt;column_name&gt;) in your edge geom to label the connections.\nThis is where interactive network graphs come in handy, as you can zoom, pan and hover to get more info.\n\n\nInteractive with {visNetwork}\nThe {visNetwork} package wraps the vis.js library to make interactive network graphs. Its visNetwork() function takes separate data frames of edges and nodes that are in a pre-specified format, so we won’t be able to use our tidygraph object for this.\n\n# Dataframe of unique nodes with an ID value\nnodes &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;%  # take our podcast-host dataset\n  distinct(Hosts) %&gt;%  # get column of unique hosts\n  arrange(Hosts) %&gt;%  # alphabetical order\n  mutate(id = as.character(row_number()), label = Hosts) %&gt;% \n  select(-Hosts) #%&gt;%  # provides pop up value on viz\n\n# Dataframe of 'origin' and 'destination' nodes for edge drawing\nedges &lt;- relay_combos %&gt;% \n  left_join(nodes, by = c(\"V1\" = \"label\")) %&gt;% \n  left_join(nodes, by = c(\"V2\" = \"label\")) %&gt;%\n  rename(from = id.x, to = id.y, title = Podcast)\n\nNow we plug the data into the visNetwork() function and pipe this into some other other functions to set some options. It’s quite a lot of code, but the piping into other vis*() functions breaks it up into more manageable chunks.\n\nvisNetwork(  # add main features\n  nodes, edges,  # add node and edge data\n  main = list(  # set main title and style it\n    text = \"The Relayverse\",\n    style = \"font-family:Lekton, monospace;font-weight:bold;font-size:30px;text-align:center;\"\n  ),\n  submain = list(  # set subtitle and style it\n    text = \"Click hosts (nodes) to see co-host relationships (edges)\",\n    style = \"font-family:Lekton, monospace;font-weight:regular;font-size:20px;text-align:center;\"\n  ),\n  footer = list(  # add a footer and style it\n    text = paste0(\"Source: Wikipedia (\", format(Sys.Date(), \"%Y/%m/%d\"), \")\"),\n    style = \"font-family:Lekton, monospace;font-weight:regular;font-size:15px;text-align:right;\"\n  )\n) %&gt;% \n  visNodes(  # node styling\n    shape = \"icon\",  # node is an icon specified below \n    icon = list(code = \"f130\", size = 75, color = \"#000000\"),  # microphone icon\n    font = list(face = \"Lekton\", size = 20)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  visEdges(  # edge styling\n    color = list(color = \"#447d9b\", highlight = \"#c83c3c\", opacity = 0.5),\n    width = 3, selectionWidth = 5  # selected edge is thicker\n  ) %&gt;% \n  visOptions(  # general graph options\n    highlightNearest = TRUE,  # on-hover highlight nearest nodes\n    nodesIdSelection = TRUE  # select node from dropdown\n  ) %&gt;%\n  visPhysics(  # set physics 'engine' and options\n    solver = \"forceAtlas2Based\", \n    forceAtlas2Based = list(gravitationalConstant = -50)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  visLayout(randomSeed = 1337) %&gt;%  # reproduce the same network each time\n  visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE) %&gt;%  # add naviagation buttons\n  addFontAwesome()  # makes sure that FontAwesome dependency is in place\n\nAnd that outputs the graph below. You can:\n\nuse the navigation buttons or your trackpad/mouse to navigate the network\nclick a node to highlight a host and their co-hosts (single hosts loop back to themselves)\nhover over an edge to show a label with the show name\nselect a host from the dropdown menu to highlight them and their co-hosts\nclick and drag a node to move it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also view the network in its own window.\nThis is a very simple example, but lots of other {visNetwork} options are available."

Have you heard of roguelikes?\nThe name is literal: they’re games that play like Rogue, a legendary dungeon-explorer from 1980 that set the bar for role-playing games.\nPerhaps most recognisably, it used ASCII text as ‘graphics’: the player controls a character denoted by the at symbol (@), while floor tiles are made of periods (.), for example.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Rogue via Thedarkb on Wikipedia\n\n\nThere are many interpretations of what exactly constitutes a ‘roguelike’, one of which is the strict ‘Berlin Interpretation’1. Must-haves include:\n\nrandomly-generated dungeons (a different map every time)\npermadeath (it’s game over when you die)\nturn-based battles (limitless thinking time, then one action)\ngrid-based (everything takes up one tile of space)\nnon-modal (all actions are possible at any time)\ncomplexity (rich problem solving with items, characters and interactions)\nresource management (items are limited and must be managed)\nhack ‘n’ slash (kill lots of monsters)\nexploration and discovery (find all corners of the map to solve problems)\n\nThese aren’t necessarily hard and fast rules—many games have added their own twist—but they provide the essence of the genre."

    "text": "{r.oguelike}\nSo I started to build an R package containing an ‘engine’ for a game in the roguelike style, called {r.oguelike}.\nYou can visit the package website or look at the source code in the GitHub repo.\n\nFor now it’s just a toy to demo some possible approaches for some of the main game elements: ‘graphics’, movement, an inventory, item use and battling.\nAs ever, everything in the package is subject to change and improvement (though I also may never finish it). Consider this a quick devlog about progress so far.2\n\nInstall (or don’t)\nYou can install from GitHub to make the package available on your machine.\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not already installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/r.oguelike\")\n\nIf you prefer, you can also play in your browser without having to install anything. I’ve set up a Binder instance of RStudio with {r.oguelike} preinstalled so you can just click the button below to launch it (it may take a moment to load):\n\n\n\nLaunch Rstudio Binder\n\n\nThis also means it’s possible to play this game from your phone, lol.\n\n Note\nThe {r.oguelike} package is a work in progress and is developing at pace. Many things explained below may have been superseded or changed by the time you read this.\n\n\n\nDemo\nTop-tip: improve immersion by changing your console colour palette to dark mode, so it’s like you’re really inside a cave, wow.\nTo begin:\n\nr.oguelike::start_game()\n\nWhen you start, the console clears and the user interface is printed.\n# # # # # # # # # \n# . . $ . . E . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . a . . # \n# . . . . . @ . # \n# # # # # # # # # \nT: 25 | HP: 10 | G: 0 | A: 0\nPress key to start\nInput: \nAt the top is a map of a dungeon room, made of floor (.) and wall (#) tiles. The room has randomly-selected dimensions from within a certain range. Within the room are randomly-placed characters and objects: the player (@), an enemy (E), and a collectible apple (a) and gold ($).\nBelow the dungeon room there’s:\n\na status/inventory bar, which gives a numeric value for Turns remaining, Hit Points, Gold and Apples3\na status message to provide information, usually to let the user know what has just happened\na prompt for the user to input a key press\n\nThe game is turn-based and begins when the user chooses a direction to move the player character. There are two methods for registering a key press:\n\npress W, A, S or D (i.e. up, left, down or right) and hit Enter\njust press an arrow key if your console supports {keypress} (not available in RStudio), a package from Gábor Csárdi that I wrote about recently\n\nIn this demo, let’s aim first for the apple. The apple will return us 1 HP when consumed, so it’s a good idea to get it in our inventory as soon as possible. So, let’s input W and Enter (or press the up arrow if {keypress} is enabled).\n# # # # # # # # # \n# . . $ . . E . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . a @ . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# # # # # # # # # \nT: 24 | HP: 10 | G: 0 | A: 0\nMoved up\nInput: \nThe console will wipe the user interface will be re-printed. You’ll notice that your character has moved up one tile, the turn counter has decreased by 1 and the status message has changed to say ‘Moved up’.\nNow we can move left to collect the apple.\n# # # # # # # # # \n# . . $ . . E . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . @ . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# # # # # # # # # \nT: 23 | HP: 10 | G: 0 | A: 1\nCollected apple (+1 A)\nInput: \nAgain, you can see the player has progressed one tile and the turn counter decreased. You’ll notice that the inventory spot for the apple increased by 1 and the status message has changed to Collected apple (+1 A) so we know what happened.\nWhat next? Let’s aim for the loot, signified by $ on the map. I’ll fast-forward to show you what happens after moving left twice and up twice.\n# # # # # # # # # \n# . . @ . . E . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# # # # # # # # # \nT: 19 | HP: 10 | G: 1 | A: 1\nFound gold (+1 G)\nInput: \nThe player now occupies the space where the gold was and the turn counter has decreased by 4. You’ll see that the status messages has updated to Found gold (+1 G) and the gold spot in the inventory has increased by 1, but note that the amount of gold is randomly selected from a range of possible values.\nThere’s one obvious target left: the enemy character (E). So if we move right twice, we’ll start an encounter.\nWhen you occupy the space of the enemy, you begin a turn-based battle. At the moment, this is actually an ‘auto-battler’: a routine is run under-the-hood where the player and enemy trade blows until one is vanquished.\nEach character has attack and HP values. Of course, you can see that the player has 10 HP to start, but they also have attack strength of 2. The enemy character starts with a randomly selected HP value from within a range, and their attack strength is 1. The player attacks first, so will receive three points of damage from the enemy that has 4 HP, for example.\n# # # # # # # # # \n# . . . . . @ . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# # # # # # # # # \nT: 12 | HP: 7 | G: 1 | A: 1\nYou win! (-3 HP)\nInput: \nSo we know we won because the status message changed to You win! and a note of how many hit points we lost: (-3 HP). Concurrently the HP in the inventory bar has reduced by that amount.\nHaving lost some HP, we can add some back by consuming the apple, an action mapped to the number 1 key on your keyboard (regardless of whether you’re using {keypress} or not).\n# # # # # # # # # \n# . . . . . @ . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# # # # # # # # # \nT: 11 | HP: 8 | G: 1 | A: 0\nAte apple (+1 HP)\nInput: \nSo we get a message Ate apple and that our hit points have increased as a result: (+1 HP). Of course, this means that the apple spot in the inventory has decreased to zero. Note that the HP maxes out at 10, so eating the apple won’t raise the HP value above that.\nThis is the end of the demo: you’ve collected all the items and defeated the enemy. But I also added a lose condition, which occurs when you run out of turns.\n# # # # # # # # # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# . . . . . . . # \n# @ . . . . . . # \n# # # # # # # # # \nT: 1 | HP: 8 | G: 1 | A: 0\nMoved left\nInput: a\nYou died (max turns)! Try again!\n&gt; \nThe game ends and the command prompt (&gt;) returns.\n\n\nEngine?\nThe technicals aren’t much to marvel at, really, but you can take a look at the code in the GitHub repo or on the website.\nI called it an ‘engine’ earlier, but that was deceitful, lol.\nIt’s just a while loop that keeps running so long as the is_alive state is set to TRUE. So running out of turns sets the is_alive value to FALSE and the loop is broken.\nThe content of the loop is run after the player inputs a key press, which results in various counters being adjusted for the HP, etc. The loop concludes by printing the room with updated player locations, inventory bar and status messsage, ready for the next input.\nThe room itself is just a matrix. When you move the player, a small calculation is done to determine where the player character should be in the next iteration. Imagine the player is in the centre of a 3 by 3 room, i.e. they’re in position [2,2] of a matrix with x and y dimensions of 3. If they move down, that’s equivalent to adding 1 to their current position, so 5 + 1 = 6. Similarly, moving right would be equivalent to adding 3, so 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nmatrix(1:9, 3)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    4    7\n[2,]    2    5    8\n[3,]    3    6    9\n\n\nThe code is pretty rough and you can see that the logic can start to become complicated quickly, but remember it’s just a demo for now.\n\n\nObvious improvements\nThere’s some obvious user-facing improvements to the features that are already in place:\n\ninteractive turn-based battles, where the user can choose what move to make (perhaps defensive moves, HP replenishment or magic)\nenemy movement, so they aren’t just stationary\ndifferent enemy types, with differing ‘AI’ (random movement, ‘chase’ player, etc) and attack/HP stats\ntraps (e.g. certain tiles are hidden traps, some collectible items are bogus)\nfog of war/vision cones (you can’t see what’s ahead until you get there, or you can only see a certain distance around you at all times)\n\nThere’s also a big-ticket item I haven’t touched: randomised or procedural dungeon generation. This is quite a big task and might end up as a blog post of its own. I encourage you to watch Herbert Wolverson’s talk at Roguelike Celebration 2020 for some ideas on this. At least at first, it could simply involve letting the player walk through doors to a few other rooms that contain randomised items.\nOn the back-end, I’ve so far written everything in base R; the only dependency is {keypress} to make inputs easier for consoles that support it. But there’s only so many if-else statements you can write before your brain explodes. To this end, I’m working in a branch to make use of the object-oriented approach of the {R6} package–as used in {ActionSquirrel}–to create general objects like enemies, rooms, etc, that should make it easier to handle and work with the elements of the game."

One option is to create a multiple-choice question, which is exactly what we need.\nI should say that {learnr} wasn’t really intended for what I’ve done – it’s better suited to longform tutorials – but using it means that I didn’t have to write the logic for a multi-choice quiz question. Shrug.\nHaving installed the package and started a {learnr}-flavoured R Markdown4 we can create a question inside a code chunk in this form:\n\nquiz(\n  caption = \"Question 1\",\n  question(\n    text = \"What is Pokemon #399?\",  # question\n    answer(\"Bidoof\"), correct = TRUE),  # right answer\n    answer(\"Drifloom\"),   # wrong\n    answer(\"Pyukumuku\"),  # wrong\n    answer(\"Rayquaza\"),   # wrong\n    random_answer_order = TRUE  # answers ordered randomly\n  )\n)\n\nBut this example is hard-coded. In our case we want to replace the subject of the question and the answers any time we want to be presented with a new question.\nLooks like we’ll need a button for users to press to signal that they want a new question."

    "section": "Step 3: generate new questions with Shiny",
    "text": "Step 3: generate new questions with Shiny\nSince {learnr} operates in a Shiny runtime in our R Markdown file, it’s no problem to use Shiny’s actionButton().\n\nactionButton(\"goButton\", \"Get Question\")  # button\n\nYou can press the button in the app to generate a new seed base don the current time and date. The seed is then used to randomly select a new question for the user.\nTo make this reactive – so that nothing will happen until the button is pressed – we can write Shiny server code in an R Markdown chunk by setting context=\"server\" in the chunk options. So here’s how we get a new seed after clicking:\n\nseed &lt;- eventReactive(\n  input$goButton,\n  {\n    seed_temp &lt;- as.numeric(Sys.time())\n    return(seed_temp)\n  }\n)\n\nThen our code needs to sample a row from the full data frame of package-function combos and isolate the name of the function the user will be quizzed on. This code is within eventReactive() and will only trigger when the button has been activated. Second, we use renderText() to take the function name and paste it into a string to create our question.\n\n# Set the reactive element\nfun_name &lt;- eventReactive(\n  input$goButton,  # on input\n  { \n    seed_val &lt;- seed()  # the newly-generated seed value\n    set.seed(seed_val)  # user-selected value is seed value\n    fun_sample &lt;- sample_n(tidy_funs, 1)  # sample a package-function combo\n    fun_name &lt;- select(fun_sample, functions) %&gt;% pull()  # just the function name\n    return(fun_name)  # return the package value\n  }\n)\n\n# Set the output\n# Generate a question that includes the sampled function name \noutput$fun_name_out &lt;- renderText({\n  paste0(\"The function `\", fun_name(), \"` is from which tidyverse package?\")\n})\n\nWe can repeat this for getting the right answer and alter the code slightly to generate a few wrong answers. A wrong answer is selected randomly from the data frame of tidyverse functions, but only once the correct answer and already-selected wrong answers have been removed. I’ve also coded it so that any package that has a function with the same name – a conflict – will also be removed before a ‘wrong’ answer is chosen.\nSo rather than the hard-coded example of a multi-choice question in Step 2, our quiz question code will look like this:\n\nquiz(\n  caption = \"Question \",\n  question(\n    text = as.character(textOutput(\"fun_name_out\")),\n    answer(as.character(textOutput(\"ans_correct_out\")), correct = TRUE),\n    answer(as.character(textOutput(\"ans_wrong1_out\"))),\n    answer(as.character(textOutput(\"ans_wrong2_out\"))),\n    answer(as.character(textOutput(\"ans_wrong3_out\"))),\n    random_answer_order = TRUE\n  )\n)\n\nSo now the text outputs will be rendered into the quiz question and this won’t change until the the ‘Get Question’ button is clicked.\nActually, that’s sort-of a lie. {learnr} remembers how it’s users have performed; it saves their progress. To erase this, we need to click ‘Start Over’ from the menu pane to clear that memory."

    "title": "Fixing londonmapbot for {rtweet} v1.0",
    "section": "Change your tune",
    "text": "Change your tune\nI made two major changes to the londonmapbot R script given {rtweet} v1.0:\n\nI used rtweet_bot() to authorise with the Twitter API, instead of create_token()\nI provided alt text with the media_alt_text argument to post_tweet()\n\nOther folks who use the same approach as londonmapbot will likely need to make these fundamental changes as well.1\nI also made a third change—to specify the filetype of the downloaded MapBox image—that will only be relevant if you forked londonmapbot or if your tweets use a downloaded image.\n\n1. Authentication\nYou need to authenticate with the Twitter API before a tweet can be posted.\nPrior to {rtweet} v1.0 you provided your tokens and keys in the create_token() function, but this will now fail with the error create_token() was deprecated in rtweet 1.0.0..\nThere are now three options for passing tokens and keys, depending on the need: rtweet_app(), rtweet_user() and rtweet_bot(). The last of these is what we need, because:\n\n[It] authenticates a bot that takes actions on behalf of an app [which] is most appropriate if you want to create a Twitter account that is run by a computer, rather than a human\n\nAs with create_token(), we still need to provide the api_key, api_secret, access_token and access_secret. As outlined in the first londonmapbot blogpost, these can be stored as named secrets in the GitHub repo itself and called into the environment with Sys.getenv().\nSo, I changed the R code to this:\n\nlondonmapbot_token &lt;- rtweet::rtweet_bot(\n  api_key       = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY\"),\n  api_secret    = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET\"),\n  access_token  = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN\"),\n  access_secret = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\")\n)\n\nWhere it was previously this:\n\nlondonmapbot_token &lt;- rtweet::create_token(\n  app = \"londonmapbot\",\n  consumer_key    = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY\"),\n  consumer_secret = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET\"),\n  access_token    = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN\"),\n  access_secret   = Sys.getenv(\"TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET\")\n)\n\nNote that you no longer need to pass the app name as an argument and that you use api_* rather than consumer_* in the arguments.\n\n\n2. Alt text\nYou can no longer post an image without alt text, which is a positive move for the package. If you try to upload without alt text, you’ll get Error: Media and alt_text must be character vectors.\nTo add alt text, you must add the argument media_alt_text to the post_tweet() function.\nSince the sampled location is different in every londonmapbot tweet, it’s not ideal to provide a single blanket statement for all images that are returned from MapBox. Sometimes the image will contain an airport, sometimes the Thames, usually a golf course.\nFor now I’ve settled on a fixed string that will be posted as the alt text for every image. This is better than nothing, but should be improved so that it’s more dynamic.\nMaybe we could infer something from the average colour of the image (I wrote about this before) or maybe predict what the terrain is, given there’s plenty of training data from old londonmapbot tweets.\nRegardless, I added alt text to the code like this:\n\nalt_text &lt;- paste(\n  \"A satellite image of a random location in Greater London,\",\n  \"provided by MapBox. Typically contains a residential or\",\n  \"industrial area, some fields or a golf course.\"\n)\n\nrtweet::post_tweet(\n  status         = latlon_details,\n  media          = temp_file,\n  media_alt_text = alt_text,\n  token          = londonmapbot_token\n)\n\nWhere it was previously like this:\n\nrtweet::post_tweet(\n  status = latlon_details,\n  media  = temp_file,\n  token  = londonmapbot_token\n)\n\nSee the image at the top of this blogpost for an example of the alt text now provided to each londonmapbot tweet.\n\n\n3. File extension\nThe R script behind londonmapbot downloads a MapBox satellite image to a temporary file created with tempfile(). It was always bad practice to omit the argument fileext = \".jpeg\" from this function, which is used to provide a file extension to the temporary filepath of the downloaded image.\nI noticed that the absence of an explicit file extension seemed to be causing an error in the execution of the R script, so I made sure to change the code to this:\n\ntemp_file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = \".jpeg\")\ndownload.file(img_url, temp_file)\n\nFrom this:\n\ntemp_file &lt;- tempfile()\ndownload.file(img_url, temp_file)\n\nA subtle change, but a necessary one. You may need to do this too if you followed what londonmapbot was doing previously."

I put a demo of this in a GitHub repo.\nThere are two things I’d like:\n\nTo improve trust further, citizens should be able to quickly open and explore the code behind a statistical report in the environment that the analyst was actually working in, with the correct R version and package dependencies.\nWhen I’m demonstrating the {drake} example, everyone in the room should have access to the same, consistent environment. This will minimise technical issues and ensure the code is being run in the intended environment.\n\nTurns out that these issues can be solved with Binder. Point 1 is addressed by adding a special badge to your README. This helps solve Point 2, proven by Landau in his {learndrake} course-in-a-package repo.\nBut what is Binder?"

It can be a little tedious, however. What if we could speed up and make more efficient the process of converting from Word to Govspeak?\nThere’s a specific Govspeak converter online that you can paste into. But it doesn’t have full coverage of the things that might appear in a Word doc, including tables. Other online converters exist, but I don’t think we should rely on third parties that are probably intended for producing general Markdown rather than Govspeak, specifically"

It’s early days in the sense that it doesn’t yet do, well… very much. But I thought the package name was funny (if unoriginal) and worth squatting. Maybe I’ll never get around to developing it, who knows.\nTo install (which is really not worth it right now, unless you want to raise an issue or pull request):\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/wordup\")\nlibrary(wordup)\n\nFor now, the principle is that you can unzip a Word document to expose a bunch of xml files (yet another thing I’ve been writing about recently, lol) that contain all the information needed to build the Word document3. As such, you can read that xml and extract all the information, styles, etc, and massage it programmatically into Govspeak format.\nPart of the process will involve taking a Word table, specifically, and converting it to a Govspeak-friendly form. I figured this might be a nice standalone tool in its itself, so I had a stab at what it could look like."

    "section": "Fantabulars",
    "text": "Fantabulars\nSo right now the wordup::table_to_govspeak() function (whose name could change at any time) does three things:\n\nHandles inputs.\nGuesses data types.\nApplies extra styles.\n\nYou can either (a) copy-paste a Word table into the function, or (b) simply copy it to the clipboard, where it can be read by the function using the {clipr} package. The function will take the string—which is basically tabs (\\t) to indicate gaps between cells and newlines (\\n) to indicate rows—and reorient it initially into a dataframe.\nOf course, all the columns will be character-class at this point. We can immediately run type.convert() over the whole dataframe to coerce each column to a more appropriate data type, if appropriate. So a character column composed of c(\"10\", \"20\", \"30) will become a numeric column of values c(10, 20, 30). But this doesn’t work for numeric values that have symbols in them, like commas as thousands separators (1,200), per cent symbols (82%) and placeholder markers to indicate things like suppressed values ([c])4. To get around this, we can strip the nuisance characters and then see if what remains looks like a number.\nFinally, there’s some specific features of Govspeak tables that need attention. It’s acceptable to have row labels, where each value in every cell of the first column should be prefaced with an octothorpe (#), and totals columns, where the entire row should be emboldened with double-asterisks (**) either side of the cells’ values.\nWhat results can be sort of… magic really. You copy a Word table in its entirety to your clipboard, run the function, and bang: the Govspeak Markdown is returned. You can see this in action in the gif at the top of this page.\nSo I can literally copy a table like this to my clipboard:\n\n\n\nColumn 1\nColumn 2\nColumn 3\nColumn 4\nColumn 5\n\n\n\n\nX\n100\n1,000\n1%\n15\n\n\nY\n200\n2,000\n2%\n12\n\n\nZ\n300\n3,000\n3%\n[c]\n\n\nTotals\n600\n6,000\n6%\n[c]\n\n\n\nAnd run this:\n\nwordup::table_to_govspeak()\n\nTo print this (and have it copied to your clipboard as the message says):\n| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 |\n| ------- | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------: |\n| X | 100 | 1,000 | 1% | 15 |\n| Y | 200 | 2,000 | 2% | 12 |\n| Z | 300 | 3,000 | 3% | [c] |\n| Totals | 600 | 6,000 | 6% | [c] |\nThe output table has been written to the clipboard.\nBoom. Note the crucial feature that the third, fourth and fifth columns are recognised as numeric—despite containing the strings ,, % and [c]—and therefore right-aligned (------:). This is entirely due to the argument ignore_regex, which defaults to removing commas, percentage symbols or anything in square brackets before it guesses what data type the column is5.\nAnd we can do fancy things like:\n\nwordup::table_to_govspeak(\n  has_row_titles = TRUE,\n  totals_rows = 4L\n)\n\nWhich outputs this thing:\n| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 |\n| ------- | ------: | ------: | ------: | ------: |\n| # X | 100 | 1,000 | 1% | 15 |\n| # Y | 200 | 2,000 | 2% | 12 |\n| # Z | 300 | 3,000 | 3% | [c] |\n| # **Totals** | **600** | **6,000** | **6%** | **[c]** |\nThe output table has been written to the clipboard.\nOf course, in practice this might get a little more complicated if you need to manually specify in the function declaration that there’s a column of row titles or some totals rows. Pish-posh. The point is that I think this is probably better than trying to (a) write the Govspeak table by hand or (b) trying to use the Govspeak converter, which just doesn’t work for this task. This also has mild, opinionated, Govspeak-related benefits over using a straightforward knitr::kable().\nIs this perfect? Ahaha, no. There’s a lot to add or improve, but I think this is a decent start and solves a (niche) problem for now6."

    "text": "Coda\nSonification has been used for a variety of applications during the pandemic as an alternate means of conveying the data.\nFor example, Jan Willem Tulp has created a page that ‘dings’ each time there’s a new case around the world. For something more complex, Mark D. Temple has published in the BMC Bioinformatics journal a paper about sonifying the COVID-19 genome (!). Meanwhile, Pedro Pereira Sarmento has sonified data to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on air pollution.\nI’m probably not the first to sonify coronavirus data in this way, and probably not even the first to do it with R, but it seemed a good time to take a look (listen?) back on things. I’m interested to hear more about what approaches others have taken."

A bunch of metadata is stored alongside the analysis that can be used later to determine the source of any dependency changes.\nI followed up with the basics of {drake}. My slides are in the following section.\nWe were also lucky to have a celebrity guest on the line: the creator of {drake}, Will Landau, who said some words about the package’s development and took questions. Will was also able to extend gratitude to Rich for having developed {remake}, a workflow manager for R that was a precursor to the development of {drake}."

    "text": "Struggles\n\nAutomate\nYou could copy-paste your old {blogdown} source code to the new Quarto structure. But why would I spend 10 minutes doing that when I could spend many more minutes writing a package to do it? I wrote before about {bd2q} (this is called ‘procrastination-driven development’).\n\n\nRedirects\nThe old blog had URLS in the form yoursite.net/YYYY/MM/DD/postname. Quarto does it like yoursite.net/YYYY-MM-DD-postname. I thought each Quarto post might need to be placed in a folder structure like YYYY/MM/DD/postname.qmd to achieve the old URL style. This is much more awkward than just putting posts in posts/.\nAha, you can instead write a little _redirects text file with a line for each old-to-new path. Given I have over 150 posts, I wrote a little script to make this file for me:\n\nredirect_to &lt;- paste0(\"/\", list.dirs(\"posts\", recursive = FALSE))\n\ndate_rx &lt;- \"\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}\"\n\ndate_portion &lt;- regexpr(date_rx, redirect_to) |&gt; \n  regmatches(redirect_to, m = _) |&gt; \n  gsub(\"-\", \"/\", x = _)\n\nname_portion &lt;- gsub(paste0(\"posts/\", date_rx, \"-\"), \"\", redirect_to)\n\nredirect_from &lt;- paste0(\"/\", date_portion, name_portion)\n\nmapping &lt;- paste0(paste(redirect_from, redirect_to, sep = \" \"), collapse = \"\\n\")\n\ncat(mapping, file = \"~/Desktop/_redirects\")\n\nOriginally I failed to include the leading slash in the redirect_from string, which would result in trying to redirect from the nonsense rostrum.blogYYYY/MM/DD/postname instead of rostrum.blog/YYYY/MM/DD/postname. Subtle.\nIn the site’s index.qmd I added a snippet to copy over the _redirects file into the site/ folder, ready for deployment.\n\n\nTw*tter\nI have some posts that used the Twitter API, like one about Wordle and a bunch about londonmapbot. The Twitter API is borked so I had to hardcode a bunch of outputs in these posts. One was really awkward: a post with a leaflet map in it. I hadn’t saved the data feeding into the map, so I ended up extracting data from the HTML of the map so I could rebuild it.\n\n\nGitHub Action\nI have a dynamic, stats-laden README.Rmd for the blog that re-renders when I push to the repo. Famously, GitHib Actions never works first time. This time it was because you have to go into Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General on GitHub and set ‘Workflow permissions’ to ‘Read and write permissions’. For some reason.\n\n\nWAV\nI have some little HTML audio whatsits on some pages. Despite putting .wav files in the appropriate place, the sounds simply wouldn’t play. It’s because you need to specify resources: in your YAML header and then list the path to each one (for me this would be like resources/roblox-oof.wav)."

    "text": "The struggle is real\nThings went pretty well, basically. It was just boring and slow2 to go through over 150 posts and perform (mostly) little corrections here and there. Herefollows some minor struggles.\n\nLoad-bearing posts\nYou could copy-paste your old {blogdown} source code to the structure and style required by Quarto. But why spend 10 minutes doing that when I could spend many more minutes creating a package to do it3? I wrote before about {bd2q}, which was useful given the number of posts. This is a little manoeuvre I call ‘procrastination-driven development’.\n\n\nTw*tter’s ex-API\nI have some posts that used the Twitter API, like one about Wordle and a bunch about londonmapbot. I ended up hardcoding the outputs in these posts because Twitter is utterly borked. One bunglesome post used API data for an interactive leaflet map, but I had failed to save the intermediate data set. To retrieve the data, I had to extract it from the rendered leaflet HTML (!) with some garish string manipulation. Never again.\n\n\nGitHub (In)Actions\nI have a dynamic, stats-laden README for the blog that re-renders when I push to the repo. Famously, GitHub Actions never works first time. This time it was because you have to go into Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General on GitHub and set ‘Workflow permissions’ to ‘Read and write permissions’. For some reason.\n\n\nTrough of a WAV\nI have some little HTML audio whatsits on some pages, like the one about sonifying covid data. Despite putting .wav files in the appropriate directory, the sounds simply wouldn’t play. It’s because you need to specify resources: in your YAML header and then list the path to each one (for me this would be like - resources/roblox-oof.wav).\n\n\nMisdirection\nThe old blog had URLs in the form rostrum.blog/YYYY/MM/DD/postname. Quarto does it like rostrum.blog/YYYY-MM-DD-postname. I thought each Quarto post might need to be placed in a folder structure like YYYY/MM/DD/postname.qmd to achieve the old URL style. This is much more awkward than just putting posts in posts/.\nAha, actually you can write a little _redirects text file with a line for each old-to-new path. Given the number of posts, I wrote a little script to generate this file4:\n\nredirect_to &lt;- paste0(\"/\", list.dirs(\"posts\", recursive = FALSE))\n\ndate_rx &lt;- \"\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}\"  # YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n# Extract date from path to Quarto post\ndate_portion &lt;- regexpr(date_rx, redirect_to) |&gt; \n  regmatches(redirect_to, m = _) |&gt; \n  gsub(\"/\", \"-\", x = _)\n\nname_portion &lt;- gsub(paste0(\"posts/\", date_rx, \"-\"), \"\", redirect_to)\n\nredirect_from &lt;- paste0(\"/\", date_portion, name_portion)\n\n# 'From' and 'to' paths on same line, separated by a space\nmapping &lt;- paste0(\n  paste(redirect_from, redirect_to, sep = \" \"),\n  collapse = \"\\n\"\n)\n\ncat(mapping, file = \"_redirects\")  # dyk cat() can save files?\n\nOriginally I failed to include the leading slash in the redirect_from string, which would result in trying to redirect from the nonsense rostrum.blogYYYY/MM/DD/postname instead of rostrum.blog/YYYY/MM/DD/postname. Subtle.\nIn the site’s index.qmd I added a snippet to copy over the _redirects file into the site/ folder, ready for deployment.\n\n\nCat egg or rice?\nAs I went through each old post, I removed all the ‘tags’ from the YAML and consolidated some of them into ‘categories’. I am still not happy with these categories. How can I extract all the categories to review them? I’m sure there’s an easier way than regexing5 them out, but this works:\n\nposts &lt;- \n  list.files(\"posts\", pattern = \".qmd\", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)\n\nget_categories &lt;- function(post_path, ignore_rx = \"resources\") {\n  \n  post_lines &lt;- readLines(post_path, warn = FALSE)\n  \n  # Categories are listed between the YAML header and closing fence\n  cats_start &lt;- which(post_lines == \"categories:\") + 1\n  cats_end &lt;- which(post_lines == \"---\")[2] - 1\n  \n  cats &lt;- NULL\n  \n  # Ignore other YAML headers and content after the categories\n  if (length(cats_start) == 1 & length(cats_end) == 1) {\n    cats &lt;- gsub(\"  - \", \"\", post_lines[cats_start:cats_end])\n    cats &lt;- cats[!grepl(ignore_rx, cats)]\n  }\n  \n  return(cats)\n  \n}\n\ncats_list &lt;- lapply(posts, \\(post) get_categories(post)) |&gt; \n  setNames(dirname(post_names))\n\nall_cats &lt;- unlist(cats_list)\n\ntable(all_cats) |&gt; sort(decreasing = TRUE)\n\nMostly just an excuse to use ‘cats’ as a variable name I think, but maybe this would be easier with some Quarto command or with the {yaml} package or something?"

A mid-life crisis precipitated by a blog transition is exactly where I saw this going, to be honest.\nOf course, I’ve always pre-ported my posts from my brain to the blog. Perhaps you agree that the next platform change should be to cut out the last step and simply keep the posts inside my head? You’re preemptively welcome."
