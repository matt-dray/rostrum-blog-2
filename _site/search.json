    "text": "tl;dr\nR is ‘a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics’. Ahahaha, no it’s not, it’s a game engine. I’ve created a ‘splendid’ list of games you can play—written in R—to prove it.

It was written to do statistical analysis and make charts. You are literally not allowed to do anything else with it. You should use <LANGUAGE> instead, which is much more suited to your specific use case. R is a joke language for nerds.\nYou should not read beyond this point if you think, quite rightly, that mirth and frivolity are unsuited to an R session.\n\n\nStats only?\nUnity. Unreal. GameMaker. Godot. All of these videogame engines are now obsolete.\nIt is R—humble R!—that represents the future of gaming.\nTo prove it, I’ve created a list of ‘splendid R games’ in a GitHub repo1 that you are welcome to contribute to.2\nYes, R can be used for fun. Do not tell R Core.\n\n\nWait, he’s serious?\nI think there’s three kinds of ‘platform’ for games written in R:\n\nFor the console\nIn Shiny\nPorted\n\nGames played in the console are pretty straightforward and probably most common. You can run some code, or a function from a package, to launch some code in the R console that you can interact with. A simple option for this might involve use of readline() to receive user input, for example, like Giora Simchoni’s excellent text-based puzzler, Castle of R.\n\n\n\nGiora’s Castle of R running in the terminal.\n\n\nShiny can give you a little more flexibility when it comes to graphics and user input, at the expense of needing to host the app and maybe some extra JavaScript skills. A great example of this is Pedro Silva’s winning entry (app, source) to the Posit Shiny contest in 2020.\n\n\n\nA still from Pedro’s Shiny Decisions app.\n\n\nThe third category is a little more boundary-pushing. Imagine if R was powerful enough to let you port existing games. Well, surprise, ya boi Mike Cheng (aka coolbutuseless) has pushed hard on expanding the capabilities of R to run fast enough and with realtime user input,3 porting the classic Another World (1991) to R, which was showcased at 2022’s Posit conference (source, video, blog).\n\n\n\nA still from Mike’s rstudio::conf(2022) presentation, featuring Another World.\n\n\nOf course, within these ‘platforms’ are genres like word games, arcade games, puzzle games, etc. Will you be the first to create an MMORPG (a massively-multiplayer online R-powered game)?\n\n\nI am an indie game dev now\nI’ve always been interested in how videogames are coded,4 wishing that I could do the same myself. Of course I could simply learn ‘real’ programming languages.\nExcept that’s blasphemy. Of course I’d rather break my own mind and spirit in an attempt to make R achieve 0.1% of what might be possible in P*thon.\nCase in point, I’ve made a few R packages containing some little toys (in order of gooddest to baddest):\n\n{r.oguelike} (source, blogs) for a procedural-dungeon explorer with enemy pathfinding and inventory\n{tamRgo} (source, blog) for a cyber pet in your R console that persists between sessions\n{safar6} (source, blog) for a text-based re-make of the Safari Zone from the first generation of Pokémon games\n{ActionSquirrel} (source, blog) for a tile-based, turn-based minigame in the R console\n{hokey} (source, blog) for minigames that use direct keypress inputs with {keypress}\n\n\n\n\nHint when playing {tamRgo}: do not forget about your pet for 138 days. RIP Kevin XVIII.\n\n\nI’ve got something in the pipeline that involves extremely rudimentary physics in the R console. Wow! For release in 2023 (because game launches never go wrong).\n\n\nReady Player 2\nThe splendid list must be missing a bunch of games. Please leave an issue or pull request in the splendid-r-games repo to add more examples.\nNext stop: letting people run R games in the browser without an installed copy of R. This is already possible with a service like Binder, which can spin up an instance of RStudio with packages pre-installed I did this for {r.oguelike}).\n\n\n\nJust like the Nokia N-Gage, amirite?\n\n\nBut soon you might be able to use WebR to play games in the browser without even spinning up RStudio, ooh. So look out for an R version of itch.io in future, lol.\n\n\n\nSession info\n\n\n\n─ Session info ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n setting  value\n version  R version 4.2.0 (2022-04-22)\n os       macOS Big Sur/Monterey 10.16\n system   x86_64, darwin17.0\n ui       X11\n language (EN)\n collate  en_US.UTF-8\n ctype    en_US.UTF-8\n tz       Europe/London\n date     2023-04-08\n pandoc   2.19.2 @ /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/quarto/bin/tools/ (via rmarkdown)\n\n─ Packages ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n package     * version date (UTC) lib source\n cli           3.6.0   2023-01-09 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n digest        0.6.31  2022-12-11 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n dplyr       * 1.1.0   2023-01-29 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n evaluate      0.20    2023-01-17 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n fansi         1.0.3   2022-03-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n fastmap       1.1.0   2021-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n generics      0.1.3   2022-07-05 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n glue          1.6.2   2022-02-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n htmltools     0.5.2   2021-08-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n htmlwidgets   1.5.4   2021-09-08 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n jsonlite      1.8.4   2022-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n knitr         1.42    2023-01-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n lifecycle     1.0.3   2022-10-07 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n magrittr      2.0.3   2022-03-30 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n pillar        1.8.1   2022-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n pkgconfig     2.0.3   2019-09-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n R6            2.5.1   2021-08-19 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rlang         1.0.6   2022-09-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rmarkdown     2.14    2022-04-25 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n rstudioapi    0.14    2022-08-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n sessioninfo   1.2.2   2021-12-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n tibble        3.1.8   2022-07-22 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n tidyselect    1.2.0   2022-10-10 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n utf8          1.2.2   2021-07-24 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n vctrs         0.5.2   2023-01-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n withr         2.5.0   2022-03-03 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n xfun          0.37    2023-01-31 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n yaml          2.3.7   2023-01-23 [1] CRAN (R 4.2.0)\n\n [1] /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/library\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nI originally labelled the GitHub repo as an ‘awesome’ repo, which I later learned has a very specific meaning. You might have seen awesome lists before, like the awesome-quarto repo by Mickaël, or the new awesome-webr list by Nan Xiao. ‘Splendid’ is much more of a Bri’ish word than ‘awesome’, so it feels more natural anyway.↩︎\nNote that I have carefully released this post just after April fool’s day, which means I am super, super serious. As usual.↩︎\nSee the {nara} and {eventloop} packages in particular.↩︎\nI like YouTube devlogs by folks like Seb Lague, ThinMatrix, SquidGod, Jonas, TanTan and others. R can never achieve what they’re up to, but I like listening through the logic of what they’re doing.↩︎\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SA 4.0"
