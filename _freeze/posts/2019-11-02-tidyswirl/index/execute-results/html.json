You should take a look at [swirl-tidy by Seo-young Silvia Kim](https://github.com/sysilviakim/swirl-tidy) instead.\n</div><p>\n\n## Swirl\n\n[Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) is a framework for [learning R from within R itself](https://swirlstats.com/students.html). You can install it with `install.packages(\"swirl\")`. Swirl courses can be created by anyone and installed from nearly anywhere, though the [Swirl course repository](https://swirlstats.com/scn/title.html) is the 'official' source.\n\nI've [written before](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/05/10/swirlify/) about how [the {swirlify} package](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/) makes it easier to create Swirl packages.\n\n## Tidyswirl\n\nI didn't talk much in my previous Swirl post about [a course I started to develop on GitHub: Tidyswirl](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl). Its purpose is to teach the packages of [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).\n\n![Placeholder logo with apologies to the tidyverse team.](resources/tidyswirl.jpg){fig-alt=\"A yellow post-it note with a design for a hexagonal sticker with 'tidyswirl' written on it, surrounded by small swirly shapes of different colours.\" width=\"25%\" fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nAt the time of publication, there are two useable lessons in Tidyswirl: one for [{tibble}](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) and one for [{tidyr}](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/). I've updated these to correct some errors and to improve the experience. In particular, I've updated the `gather()` and `spread()` functions to `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, given [the update in {tidyr} 1.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/).\n\nI started with these packages because of the relatively limited number of functions compared to other packages and because they're involved typically in the early stages of a data analysis workflow.\n\nTry it by installing Swirl and Tidyswirl:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install Swirl\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\")\nlibrary(swirl)\n\n# Install the Tidyswirl course\ninstall_course_github(\"matt-dray\", \"tidyswirl\")\n\n# Start Swirl\n# Tidyswirl will be one of the course options\nswirl()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Lesson format\n\nFor each lesson, the focal package is introduced and its roles and relationships in a tidyverse workflow are explained.\n\nSelected functions are introduced and explained in conceptual groups, before test questions are asked to let the learner try it out and test their understanding.\n\nLessons end with a reminder of the package's purpose and with links to useful external materials.\n\nYou can take a look at the lesson files for the [{tibble}](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/blob/master/tibble/lesson.yaml) and [{tidyr}](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/blob/master/tidyr/lesson.yaml) lessons as examples, though I've also added [a template lesson](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/blob/master/template/lesson.yaml) too.\n\n## Help!\n\nTidyswirl is unlikely to be finished anytime soon but it seems worth letting people know it exists. It'd be great for you to [contribute to a lesson](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)—which includes writing a new one for any of the other tidyverse packages—or [report any issues or bugs](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/issues) you find when using it.\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-07-24 19:34:16 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.23    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.33     rlang_1.1.1       fontawesome_0.5.1 evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>",
