It's an introduction to R, RStudio, R Projects, directory structure and the tidyverse. It uses [Pokémon Go](http://origin.pokemongo.com/)[^pogo] data that I collected myself.[^draytasets]\n\nYou can:\n\n* [visit the page where the training is hosted](https://matt-dray.github.io/beginner-r-feat-pkmn/)\n* [look at the source on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/beginner-r-feat-pkmn)\n* [access a 'follow along' R script prepared by a colleague](https://github.com/matt-dray/beginner-r-feat-pkmn/blob/master/beginner-r-feat-pkmn_follow-along.R)\n\nIt's pretty rudimentary in content and design but it got the job done. I'm unlikely to update it any time soon. Feel free to use all of it, parts of it, or even [fork it on GitHub and improve it](https://github.com/matt-dray/beginner-r-feat-pkmn).\n\n## Other materials\n\nWhy didn't I just use materials that are already out there? Well, I find it easier to teach material that I know well and that's particularly true for things I've written myself. Also I couldn't find any Pokémon-themed guides, so it was obviously inevitable.\n\nBelow are some other training materials to consider. I'm certain some of these will be out of date over time, or better things will emerge, but I'm unlikely to come back and update this post in the meantime.\n\n### Starting with R and RStudio\n\n* [Software Carpentry's Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)\n* [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) teaches you R interactively, from within RStudio itself\n* Further information about R Projects is available from the [RStudio Support pages](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)\n* [Starting data analysis/wrangling with R: Things I wish I'd been told](http://reganmian.net/blog/2014/10/14/starting-data-analysiswrangling-with-r-things-i-wish-id-been-told/) by Stian Håklev\n* [Basics of 'tidy' data and the 'tidyverse' of packages](http://rpubs.com/aelhabr/tidyverse-basics)\n\n### Going further\n\n* [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](http://stat545.com/) from STAT 545 at the Uni of British Columbia\n* [Online learning from RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/): R Programming, Shiny, R Markdown and Data Science\n* An [exhaustive Quora question](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-resources-for-learning-R-1) with links to resources\n\n### Data Science in R\n\n* [An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R](http://moderndive.com/) by ModernDive\n* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [exercise solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/)\n\n### Getting help\n\n* [RStudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), including help with {readr}, {dplyr} and {ggplot2}\n* Often it helps to produce a small [reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (a 'reprex') of your code if you run into trouble\n* [Getting help with R](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552336-Getting-Help-with-R) page of resources from RStudio\n* Explore questions and answers tagged as `r` on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-08-07 23:00:24 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.23    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.33     rlang_1.1.1       evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^pogo]: Add me as a friend on Pokémon Go.
