A table is pasted into a text box, then a checkbox is ticked to say that the table has row titles and the number 4 is written into a text box that asks for row numbers that contain totals. The 'convert to Govspeak' button is clicked and a special Markdown version of the pasted table is printed. A 'copy' button underneath it is clicked.\" fig-width=\"100%\"}\n\n## tl;dr\n\nI made [a demo Shiny app](https://matt-dray.github.io/govspeakify-tables/) that's hosted with GitHub Pages but runs serverless in the browser, thanks to [{shinylive}](https://github.com/posit-dev/shinylive). It converts a copied table to Govspeak Markdown, the format required for publishing reports by the UK's government.\n\n## Rise\n\nStastistical reports in the UK public sector are often prepared as Word documents. However, they need to be uploaded to the UK government's publishing system as a special, simplified flavour of Markdown called '[Govspeak](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/guide)'. There's [an online tool](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/) to help with this, but it doesn't yet handle the conversion of tables.\n\n[I wrote recently](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2023-06-21-wordup-tables/) about a little function I made to transform Word tables to Govspeak. It suits me to run the function within R, but this approach isn't ideal for colleagues who aren't R users (imagine!). \n\nA Shiny app could be useful here. But that's a bit of a faff; where would I serve it from? I don't have access to a server and all my free slots on shinyapps.io are taken up. \n\nBut! Thanks to recent developments[^joe] in [Shinylive](https://github.com/posit-dev/shinylive) and [{webR}](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/), I can serve the app from GitHub pages and have all the computation happen in the user's browser. \n\n## And shine\n\nThe first step was to create a Shiny app to 'govspeakify' a table. Nothing fancy, I just wanted:\n\n1. A text field to receive a copied table.\n2. Some interactive options for additional Govspeak formatting (to mark-up row titles and totals rows, and provide a regular expression for characters to ignore when evaluating numeric columns so that they'll end up right-aligned).\n3. A button to convert the table to Govspeak.\n4. The Govspeak output printed to the screen.\n5. A button to copy the output to the clipboard.\n\nSo, a button-click triggers the conversion of the pasted table via `eventReactive()`, given the user-supplied formatting options. The output is presented back to the user, along with a button to copy it, thanks to [{rclipboard}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rclipboard). \n\nYou can find the app code in [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/govspeakify-tables). I prepared the app in a single `app.R` file, along with an `R/conversion.R` file with bespoke functions. I housed these in a `govspeakify-tables` subfolder.\n\nThere's a number of things I want to add or improve to this proof of concept. For example, some more defensive programming to protect against invalid inputs and perhaps some more explanations and styling. You will be able to break it very easily. For now it does what I need it to do.\n\n## And live!\n\nSo, I have the Shiny app; how do we prepare it? The [{shinylive}](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/) package has a one-liner function that will generate a single folder containing your app and all the necessary bits and bobs from [the Shinylive project](https://github.com/posit-dev/shinylive) so it can be served by GitHub Pages but perform computations in the user's browser. \n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Run `shinylive::export(\"govspeakify-tables\", \"docs\")` to take the Shiny app and assets from the `govspeakify-tables` folder and generate a deployable version of it in a folder called `docs/` (since this is a folder name that GitHub Pages can serve from).\n2. Run `httpuv::runStaticServer(\"docs\")` to launch the app in a local static server and check that it works as intended (this requires the development version of {httpuv} at the time of writing, which you can install [from GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv)).\n3. Push to your GitHub repo and set up GitHub Pages to serve the `docs/` folder (from the repo, go to the 'Settings' tab, click 'Pages' in the sidebar, select the 'main' branch and '/docs' folder from the dropdowns, then click the 'Save' button).\n\nGitHub will take a moment to ready your app, but it's then available on the web via a URL in the form 'https://username.github.io/repo-name'. The Govspeakify Tables app can be found here: [https://matt-dray.github.io/govspeakify-tables](https://matt-dray.github.io/govspeakify-tables) (may take a sec to load).\n\nSome of these instructions may change as tools like Shinylive (the asset-preparation system), {shinylive} (the package) and {webR} continue to develop. I realised later that Rami has also [recorded these steps in a README](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/shinylive-r), so you may want to look there in future for more up-to-date information.\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-10-08 18:38:43 CEST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/Rome\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.6.1 rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.25    knitr_1.44        jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.40        \n[13] digest_0.6.33     rlang_1.1.1       evaluate_0.22    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^joe]: Joe Cheng [spoke about Shinylive](https://jcheng5.github.io/posit-conf-2023-shinylive/) at the recent Posit conference.",
