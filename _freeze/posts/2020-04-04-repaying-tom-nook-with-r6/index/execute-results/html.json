You can catch insects and fish, design clothes, fill a museum with fossils, develop the infrastructure of the island and interact with other players. It's pretty chill.[^isolation] The latest version, New Horizons, was recently released.[^nh]\n\n### Tom Nook\n\n[Tom Nook](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Nook) is a [tanuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog). Depending on who you ask, he's either a maniacal [rip-off merchant](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7jyjd/tom-nook-ripping-you-off-animal-crossing-new-horizons-bells-to-usd),[^tanuki] or [a misunderstood chap](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184928/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-interview-tom-nook) who gives you several interest-free home loans with no obligation.\n\n### Automatic Bell Dispenser\n\nThe in-game currency is [Bells](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Bells), which can be gained by selling things, helping residents, hitting rocks with a spade and joining the 'stalk market' by buying and flipping turnips. You use an [Automatic Bell Dispenser](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Automatic_Bell_Dispenser) to deposit, withdraw and make loan payments.\n\n### R6 {#r6}\n\nR is primarily a function-focused language: mostly you're writing functions that output objects.\n\nBut there's also Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is common in many other languages. OOP brings together values (fields) and functions (methods) into classes. You can interact with a class via its methods, which may trigger further internal methods and update the values. You can also create subclasses that add to or amend the logic of its parent. \n\nYou may have heard of the object-oriented systems [S3](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html) and [S4](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s4.html) in R; R6 provides another, newer implementation of OOP. There are two important things to know about R6 objects. To simplify, they're:\n\n* _encapsulated_, meaning that you apply the methods to object directly, like `object$some_method()`\n* _mutable_, meaning that fields are updated as you apply the methods\n\nI'm not going into depth about OOP and R6 here. For more, I recommend:\n\n* the [{R6} introduction vignette](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html) by [Winston Chang](https://twitter.com/winston_chang)\n* a chapter in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)[^ad-r-solutions]\n* the article '[How to explain OOP concepts to a 6-year-old](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/)' by Alexander Petkov of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)\n\nA really intriguing and illustrative use-case of R6 is [Giora Simonchi](http://giorasimchoni.com/)'s [Castle of R](http://giorasimchoni.com/2017/09/10/2017-09-10-you-re-in-a-room-the-castleofr-package/), which is a text adventure game for R (!). Here, classes are things like 'room' and 'door' that have specific properties and actions you can take on them. As you play, the fields are modified depending on your location, interactions you've had, or items you're carrying.\n\n## Demo {#demo}\n\nThe R6 chapter of the Advanced R book has [an exercise](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html#exercises-44) about building a bank account class.\n\nInspired by this, I've built an `AutomaticBellDispenser` class with certain fields (`savings` and `loan` values) and methods (`deposit()`, `withdraw()` and `loan_payment()` functions) that mimic the functionality of an Automatic Bell Dispenser. [^optimised]\n\n![The Automatic Bell Dispenser interface.

I'll explain below how to:\n\n* start a new instance of the class\n* use the `deposit()` method to increase the value of the `savings` field\n* use the `withdraw()` method to decrease the `savings` field\n* use the `pay_loan()` method to decrease the value of the `loan` field\n\n#### Initialise\n\nYou can start, or 'initialise', an instance of the class by calling `new()` on the class name and assigning it. I've called my object `account`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount <- AutomaticBellDispenser$new()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,498,000 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 0 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 loan_payment()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInitialising the class also triggers the printing of the current account details and instructions. This mimics the interface you see on the Automatic Bell Dispenser in-game.\n\nIn this case, you can see that we have zero savings, but a multi-million loan to pay off (!). This value represents the final loan amount that Nook sets you in the game.[^fish-price]\n\n#### Make a deposit\n\nNow we can make a deposit to our account. Use `$` notation to say 'to the `account` object apply the `deposit` method'. In this case, the value supplied to `deposit` is the amount of Bells. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount$deposit(1000)\naccount  # check status of account\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,498,000 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 1,000 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 loan_payment()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou could also access the `savings` field directly from the `account` object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount$savings\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo we now have savings of 1000 Bells! Of course, I just made up that value. I could add as much as I want. Use your imagination!\n\nIn the game you have to complete various tasks to add money to your pocket. You can then deposit from your pocket into your savings. I haven't created the concept of 'pockets' in this demo, but you could create a `pocket` class. You could also, for example, create a `fish` class with subclasses for each species, including their trade value. You could, in theory, mimic the entirety of Animal Crossing in this way.\n\n#### Withdraw and pay loan\n\nWe can also withdraw Bells and make loan payments with this class. \n\nNote that you can chain method calls together with `$` between them, so we could withdraw 200 Bells and make a loan payment of 300 Bells at once.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount$withdraw(200)$loan_payment(300)\naccount\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,497,700 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 500 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 loan_payment()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo the loan amount was reduced by 300 Bells, but our savings reduced by 500 Bells (200 + 300 Bells).\n\nImportant point: notice how we didn't have to overwrite the `account` object to update the values? Remember that this is because the class is [_mutable_](#r6).\n\nAs in the game, you can also choose to transfer everything in your savings by providing `full_amount = TRUE` rather than a value amount.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount$loan_payment(full_amount = TRUE)\naccount\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAutomatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n🔔 Loan Balance: 2,497,200 Bells\n🐖 Savings Balance: 0 Bells\n\nPlease make a selection from the menu below\n\n 🏠 loan_payment()\n ⬆️ deposit()\n ⬇️ withdraw()\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo the loan balance has gone down by a further 500 bells, which was the remainder of our savings.\n\n#### Messages\n\nThere are some limits to the Automatic Bell Dispenser system; there's no overdraft and the outstanding loan amount can't be negative, for example. I built a few warnings and errors into the class to handle these situations. For example:\n\n* warning -- you can only pay in whole Bells (decimal amounts are rounded down to the nearest whole number)\n* warning -- you can't remove more savings than you have (defaults to removing the maximum amount you have in savings)\n* warning -- you can't pay off more than the total loan amount (defaults to paying total remaining loan)\n* error -- once you pay off your loan, you can't make more payments!\n\nYou'll also get a celebratory message when the loan reaches zero.\n\nSo, for example, here's what happens if you try to pay off the loan with more savings than you have and if you also try to pay in decimal Bells:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount$deposit(1000)$loan_payment(1001.10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Payment rounded to 1001 Bells.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Paid total amount from savings instead: 1000 Bells.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe got two warnings:\n\n1. The decimal value was rounded down to the nearest integer\n1. We tried to pay off 1001 Bells, but only had a total of 1000 Bells\n\nThe result is that our savings are empty and the loan is 1000 Bells lighter.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount$savings\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount$loan\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2496200\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd if we add enough Bells to pay off the loan?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naccount$deposit(2496200)$loan_payment(full_amount = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n😃 Sweet! I finally finished paying off my very last home loan! 🎉 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Build the class\n\nI wanted to point out a few elements of the code that went into building the class. You can refer back to the full code in [the expandable section above](#demo).\n\nFirst, the basic structure is a call to `R6::R6Class()`, which contains the name of the class and a list of values and fields.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAutomaticBellDispenser <- R6Class(  # call the function, assign a name\n  \"AutomaticBellDispenser\",  # class name\n  list(\n    # truncated (fields and methods go here)\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are two fields in this class, which are put inside the `list()` with some starting values:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#...\n  # set initial values for fields\n  savings = 0,     # start from zero\n  loan = 2498000,  # loan size\n#...\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere's an `initialize()` method that I've used to print the Automatic Bell Dispenser display when a new instance of the class is started. It reformats values and uses emoji for the lols.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#...\n  # show on startup the account status and options\n  initialize = function(...) {\n    loan_formatted <- format(  # reformat the loan field value\n      self$loan,          # the 'loan' field from this class (i.e. 'itself')\n      big.mark = \",\",     # format as '1,000' rather than '1000'\n      scientific = FALSE  # prevent 12000000 being displayed as '1.2e+07'\n    )\n    savings_formatted <- format(  # reformat the savings field value\n      self$savings, big.mark = \",\", scientific = FALSE\n    )\n    cat(\"Automatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\\n\\n\")  # cat() prints to console\n    cat(emo::ji(\"bell\"), \"Loan Balance:\", loan_formatted, \"Bells\\n\")\n    cat(emo::ji(\"pig2\"), \"Savings Balance:\", savings_formatted, \"Bells\\n\\n\")\n    cat(\n      \"Please make a selection from the menu below\\n\\n\",\n      emo::ji(\"house\"), \"loan_payment()\\n\",\n      emo::ji(\"arrow_up\"), \"deposit()\\n\",\n      emo::ji(\"arrow_down\"), \"withdraw()\"\n    )\n  },\n#...\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe same code is used in the `print()` method too, which means that these details will be printed whenever you call your object.\n\nThe methods for `deposit()`, `withdraw()` and `loan_payment()` look similar, but have slightly different behaviour. The simplest is `deposit()`, which makes the input an integer and warns the user if a decimal value has been used, then adds the amount to the `savings` field.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#...\n  deposit = function(amount = 0) {    # function takes an amount to deposit\n    amount_int <- as.integer(amount)  # round to nearest lowest integer\n    if (amount - amount_int > 0) {    # warning if rounding has occurred\n      warning(\n        \"Deposit rounded to \", amount_int, \" Bells.\\n\",\n        call. = FALSE # prevents printing of the error-causing line\n      )\n    } else {\n      self$savings <- self$savings + amount_int  # add amount to savings\n    }\n    invisible(self)  # return but don't print\n  }\n#...\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote how the field values are accessed with `self$field_name`. We also return `self` at the end, but it's wrapped in `invisible()` so it updates the field without printing.\n\n## What now, squirt?\n\nSo now you know how I've been spending my time during this period of enforced isolation: playing Animal Crossing, messing about with R or, most importantly, messing around with Animal Crossing in R.\n\nWhile this use of {R6} has been totally frivolous, it's helped me understand OOP a bit better and get more of an insight into how R works.\n\nI recommend you take a look at the Advanced R book, which is [online for free](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) or can be [purchased](https://www.crcpress.com/Advanced-R-Second-Edition/Wickham/p/book/9780815384571),[^sponsor] for a better understanding of OOP and its implementations in R.\n\nI also recommend getting hold of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Just be wary of that raccoon guy...\n\n![Tip: the lucrative Tarantula Island will help you satiate Nook's thirst for Bells.](resources/ac-tarantula.jpg){fig-alt=\"The pocket interface in Animal Crossing, showing all available space filled with tarantulas.\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-07-22 15:30:34 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] emo_0.0.0.9000 R6_2.5.1      \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] digest_0.6.33     assertthat_0.2.1  lubridate_1.9.2   fastmap_1.1.1    \n [5] xfun_0.39         magrittr_2.0.3    glue_1.6.2        stringr_1.5.0    \n [9] knitr_1.43.1      htmltools_0.5.5   timechange_0.2.0  generics_0.1.3   \n[13] rmarkdown_2.23    lifecycle_1.0.3   cli_3.6.1         vctrs_0.6.3      \n[17] compiler_4.3.1    purrr_1.0.1       rstudioapi_0.15.0 tools_4.3.1      \n[21] evaluate_0.21     yaml_2.3.7        crayon_1.5.2      rlang_1.1.1      \n[25] jsonlite_1.8.7    htmlwidgets_1.6.2 stringi_1.7.12   \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^ages]: Literally the most important question in 2020.\n[^nh]: My island has peaches and lillies.
