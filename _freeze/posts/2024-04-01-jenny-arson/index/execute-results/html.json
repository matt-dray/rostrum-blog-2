Perpetually.\n\n## Passing the torch\n\n[Jenny once said](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/):\n\n> If the first line of your R script is `rm(list = ls())` I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE üî•.\n\nThe objects in your R environment are wicked little imps whose only motivation is to deceive you. They must be destroyed. Frequently. \n\nBut `rm()` isn't enough to start with a completely a clean slate. It doesn't detach packages, for example. Reproducibility is at stake here, folks!\n\nThe only salvation is to completely restart R. All the time.\n\nI don't think you heard me. Come closer. I said _all the time_.\n\n## An extinguisher\n\nI've been [woke to this thought technology](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2020-04-17-r-self-shame/index.html#env) for a while. You're right, it's time I gave back to the community.\n\nI can't trust you to restart R voluntarily, so I must help you to help yourself.\n\nSo, I have for you a gift. A precious snippet of R code that came to me in a fever dream.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsetHook(\n  \"rstudio.sessionInit\",\n  function(...) {\n    message(\"‚è≥ You have 30 seconds...\")\n    Sys.sleep(30)\n    rstudioapi::executeCommand(\"restartR\")\n  }\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSimply open your `.Rprofile` ([a special file](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/360047157094-Managing-R-with-Rprofile-Renviron-Rprofile-site-Renviron-site-rsession-conf-and-repos-conf) that's executed at start up) with `usethis::edit_r_profile()`[^dont1], paste in the code[^dont2] and then restart R for it to take effect[^dont3].\n\nWhat does it do? When RStudio starts up it waits for 30 seconds and restarts R[^thespicemelange].\n\n...Which prompts another restart after 30 more seconds.\n\n...And another.\n\n...Forever[^quit].\n\n![trapped in a loop help I'm](resources/restart.png){fig.alt=\"The R console in RStudio. Repeated several times is the texrt 'restarting in 30 seconds...' then 'restarting R session'.\" width='100%'}\n\nI know what you're thinking: doesn't this block the console? Kind of. You can still type stuff and it'll be executed before the next restart. Only to disappear immediately. \n\nJust like Jenny wanted! I think?\n\n## Rise from the ashes\n\nHow can you thank me for this? I am humble (extremely), but you're welcome to [support my Patreon](https://github.com/scrogster/rickrollR/).\n\nHappy March 32nd, colleagues.\n\n### Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2024-03-28 11:05:02 GMT\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.2        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.8   rstudioapi_0.16.0 yaml_2.3.8       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.26    knitr_1.45        jsonlite_1.8.8    xfun_0.43        \n[13] digest_0.6.35     rlang_1.1.3       evaluate_0.23    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^dont1]: Don't.\n[^dont2]: Don't.\n[^dont3]: Fine, [do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCscYsICvoA).\n[^quit]: Maybe you'll have to force quit RStudio?
