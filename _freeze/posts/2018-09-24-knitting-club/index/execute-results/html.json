Knitting Club ([see the slides](https://matt-dray.github.io/knitting-club/) or [source](https://github.com/matt-dray/knitting-club))\n2. Quick R Markdown (see the [slides](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/#1) or [source](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/)).\n\n## Reproducibility\n\nIt's often important to recreate and verify prior work, as well as update it in future as data changes. In government we're using a code-based approach called [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/) (RAP) to automate and make reproducible our statistical publications; speeding up our work while reducing error and building confidence.\n\nR has many packages that help with reproducibility. Take a look at [the CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html) for some examples.\n\n[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a particularly useful and ubiquitous tool. It allows you to execute R code inside your document and 'knit' it into a readable report with the {knitr} package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/). You can re-run the code, or alter the parameters and re-knit it without stress. This is much faster and less error-prone versus a workflow that moves data between a database, spreadsheet and word processor.\n\nThe [R Markdown bible](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) has been released recently by Yihui Xie, JJ Allaire and Garrett Grolemund and is the go-to resource for creating [reports, presentations, dashboards, websites, books and blogs](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) in R Markdown.\n\n## Resources\n\nI made some short resources earlier in the year to help beginners in my organisation learn about R Markdown. They're a little rough, but got the job done. I'm unlikely to update them in future, but you can go to the source on GitHub and leave an issue, or make a pull request.\n\n### 1. Knitting Club\n\nKnitting Club is a document about R Markdown and {knitr} made with R markdown and {knitr}. It's [freely available on the web](https://matt-dray.github.io/knitting-club/) and you can find [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/knitting-club). \n\nI presented this document in a cross-department [Coffee & Coding](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/resource-coffee-and-coding.html) session in April 2018. The blurb was:\n\n> Do you have *woolly* knowledge of document creation in R? *Needle* little help? Matt Dray will drop some *purls* of wisdom and *unravel a yarn* about the *knitty*-gritty of R Markdown and the ‘knitr’ package for one-click document creation. Don’t get the *point*? If a deadline is *looming*, you’ll avoid a *stitch*-up from endless re-running of code and copy-pasting of outputs into a Word document. Come along and have *a ball*!\n\nHa.\n\n### 2. Quick R Markdown\n\nIf the Knitting Club document is too long, you can check out this shorter slide-based introduction to R Markdown below. You can also [access the slides alone](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/#1) and find [the source on GitHub](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"shareagain\" style=\"min-width:300px;margin:1em auto;\" data-exeternal=\"1\">\n<iframe src=\"https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" style=\"border:FALSE;\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<script>fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});</script>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-08-08 17:55:32 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2   compiler_4.3.1      fastmap_1.1.1      \n [4] cli_3.6.1           tools_4.3.1         htmltools_0.5.5    \n [7] xaringanExtra_0.7.0 rstudioapi_0.15.0   yaml_2.3.7         \n[10] rmarkdown_2.23      knitr_1.43.1        jsonlite_1.8.7     \n[13] xfun_0.39           digest_0.6.33       rlang_1.1.1        \n[16] evaluate_0.21      \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>",
