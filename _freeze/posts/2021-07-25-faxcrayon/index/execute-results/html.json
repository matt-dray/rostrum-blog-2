The code will always be available on GitHub, but the site may disappear. C'est la vie.\n\n</div>\n\n## Art is a lie\n\nTurns out you can just put up some pictures on the internet and call it a gallery. No one is stopping you.\n\nHere is a foolproof approach: R Markdown with {bs4cards} to write the content, GitHub Pages to serve it, and a totally rad URL to convince people you're legit.\n\n## {bs4cards}\n\nThe [{bs4cards}](https://bs4cards.djnavarro.net/articles/introduction.html) package (available on CRAN) is great because it lets you create customisable 'cards' that you can tile on an R Markdown page.\n\nTo create a card, you use the `card()` function with arguments for `title`, `image`,[^alt] `text`, `link`, etc. You can put these in a list and pass that to `card_grid()` to make a grid. Of cards. A card grid.\n\nSo, this format could work well to bring disparate information together in one central location, like a blog's landing page, where a card's content gives you a preview of post that you can click to visit it.\n\nSo I did just that: [I made a single page](https://github.com/matt-dray/faxcrayon)[^site] where each card displays an art piece I created with R code for [#RecreationThursday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23recreationthursday), or whatever.\n\nThe cards contain the creation date in the header; the 'name' of the piece as the card title, which links out to where the code is hosted for recreating it; and in the card body it states whether the image is a recreation, a remix or something original.\n\n![](resources/cards.png){fig-alt=\"Example of three cards made use the bs4cards package. Each one has a header with the date in, a square image in the middle, the name of the piece which is a link, and some body text that explains whether the piece is original, a remix or a recreation.\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nYou can find [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/faxcrayon).\n\n### GitHub Pages\n\nOne of the easiest ways to serve an R Markdown file on the internet is to store it in a GitHub repository, knit it to HTML and then [enable GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). \n\nYou go to the 'Pages' in your repository's settings to enable it and then your HTML is served so that it's available to anyone on the internet in the form <username.github.io/repository-name/file.html>.[^index]\n\n### Domain\n\nBut that doesn't make for a terribly exciting URL. Since I'm going to be an internationally-famous and extremely financially-successful artist, it makes sense to improve [my online brand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPHK494AUxE) with a rad URL.\n\nWhere to get inspiration? I've tweeted images for #RecreationThursday using the fax[^fax] üì† and crayon üñçÔ∏è emojis because I was using my rudimentary skills to create facsimile copies of original artworks. So... fax crayon? Like a wax crayon, but, like, fax? \n\nAnd the <faxcrayon.art> URL only cost two dollars to buy, so.\n\nThere's [a small dance](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#about-custom-domain-configuration) you have to do to make GitHub Pages link to your domain, while your domain provider may themselves require [a particular set of settings](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/).\n\nIt took half an hour or so for the domain dance to complete, but now the site is available at [faxcrayon.art](https://www.faxcrayon.art).\n\n## Nothing is real\n\nSo: {bs4cards}, GitHub Pages and a totally hip URL.\n\nNow I just need to work out how to integrate NFT[^nft] functionality to the site and quit my day job.\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-07-17 18:32:26 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.23    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.31     rlang_1.1.1       fontawesome_0.5.1 evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^index]: If you're feeling fancy, you can call your file 'index.Rmd', which knits to 'index.html', which GitHub Pages serves with the slightly more succinct URL <username.github.io/repository-name>.\n[^fax]: Younglings, the fax machine is an ancient and possibly imaginary piece of technology that's a mash-up of a telephone, photocopier and printer.
