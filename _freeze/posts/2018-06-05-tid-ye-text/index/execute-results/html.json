So what's been on his mind?\n\nI think the real question is why don't we scrape Yeezus's lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.\n\n## Genius\n\n[Genius](https://genius.com/) is a website where you can upload and comment on song lyrics. It's like [Pop Up Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vam8l-JtqcI) for young people.\n\nYou can access the lyrics data via Genius's API[^3]. Luckily, the R package [{geniusr} was developed by Ewen Henderson](https://github.com/ewenme/geniusr) for exactly this purpose.[^4] \n\n## Access the API\n\nYou need to register with Genius so you can get tokens for accessing their API. To do this:\n\n1. [Create a new Genius API client](https://genius.com/api-clients/new).\n2. Click 'generate access token' under 'client access token' to generate an access token.\n3. After `install.packages(\"geniusr\")`, `library(geniusr)` you'll be prompted to enter the access token when you try to use a {geniusr} function\n\nI stored the token in my .Renviron file. This is a file for store variables that R will look for and load automatically on startup. Edit the file on your system by running `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and adding the line `GENIUS_API_TOKEN=X`, replacing X with your token.\n\nIf you don't store your token this way then you'll be prompted for a new token every time you start a new R session, which could get quite tedious. It also means you don't have to store it in plain sight\n\n## Use {geniusr}\n\n### Find Kanye\n\nFirst we need to find the artist ID for Kanye. We can use `search_artist()` to look for him.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(geniusr)\n\nsearch_artist(\"kanye west\") %>% knitr::kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n| artist_id | artist_name | artist_url |\n| :------ | :----- | :------ |\n| 72 | Kanye West | https://genius.com/artists/Kanye-west |\n| 652275 | JAY-Z & Kanye West | https://genius.com/artists/Jay-z-and-kanye-west |\n\nKanye's ID on Genius is 72 as a solo artist. We can save this value as the object `kanye_id` and use it to get metadata about him. This includes the web address for his artist page on Genius, a link to the image of him used on the site and the number of people 'following' his lyrics page.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkanye_id <- 72\nartist_meta <-get_artist_meta(artist_id = kanye_id)\nglimpse(artist_meta)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nObservations: 1\nVariables: 5\n$ artist_id        <int> 72\n$ artist_name      <chr> \"Kanye West\"\n$ artist_url       <chr> \"https://genius.com/artists/Kanye-west\"\n$ artist_image_url <chr> \"https://images.genius.com/92fee84306e9a1ec88...\n$ followers_count  <int> 8754\n```\n\n### Get songs\n\nNow we can use Kanye's artist ID to obtain *all* his songs on Genius.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkanye_songs <- get_artist_songs(artist_id = kanye_id)\n\nkanye_songs %>%\n  sample_n(5) %>%\n  select(song_name) %>% \n  knitr::kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n| song_name |\n| :------ |\n| Can’t Tell Me Nothing (Official Remix) (Ft. Jeezy) |\n| Last Call |\n| Oh Oh |\n| See You In My Nightmares (Live From VH1 Storytellers) |\n| Paranoid (Ft. Mr. Hudson) |\n\nWe can also access a greater list of data for each song, including the album name and release date. We can use the `map_df` function from the {purrr} package to look for the meta data for each song in turn. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nsongs_meta <- map_df(kanye_songs$song_id, get_song_meta)\n\nsample_n(songs_meta, 10) %>% \n  select(song_name, album_name) %>% \n  knitr::kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n| song_name | album_name |\n| :------ | :------ |\n| Never See Me Again | NA |\n| Olskoolicegre | I’m Good |\n| Just Soprano Freestyle | NA |\n| BET Cypher 2010 (Kanye West, Big Sean, Pusha T, & Common) (Ft.

Maybe we'll explore the other lyrics more deeply another day.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nye <- songs_meta %>% filter(album_name == \"ye\")\nselect(ye, song_name)\n```\n:::\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 x 1\nsong_name                  \n<chr>                      \n1 All Mine                   \n2 Ghost Town                 \n3 I Thought About Killing You\n4 No Mistakes                \n5 Violent Crimes             \n6 Wouldn't Leave             \n7 Yikes\n```\n\nWe can fetch the lyrics from Genius for each song now that we have their details. We can do this using `map_df()` again to apply the `scrape_lyrics_url()` function to each row of our dataframe, where each row represents a single song. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nye_lyrics <- map_df(\n  ye$song_lyrics_url,\n  scrape_lyrics_url\n)\n\nye_lyrics <- ye_lyrics %>%\n  group_by(song_name) %>% \n  mutate(line_number = row_number()) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  left_join(ye, by = \"song_name\")\n\nye_lyrics %>% \n  sample_n(10) %>% \n  select(line, song_name) %>% \n  knitr::kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n| line | song_name |\n| :------ | :------ |\n| It’s a different type of rules that we obey | I Thought About Killing You |\n| This not what we had in mind | Ghost Town |\n| We could wait longer than this | Wouldn’t Leave |\n| Not havin’ ménages, I’m just bein’ silly | Violent Crimes |\n| Shit could get menacin’, frightenin’, find help | Yikes |\n| Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw | Violent Crimes |\n| Sometimes I take all the shine | Ghost Town |\n| Baby, don’t you bet it all | Ghost Town |\n| Premeditated murder | I Thought About Killing You |\n| But that’s not the case here | I Thought About Killing You |\n\n## Break the lyrics down\n\n### Words\n\n#### Extract\n\nNow we've got the lines separated, we can bring in [the {tidytext} package from Julia Silge and David Robinson](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html) to break the lines into 'tokens' for further text analysis. Tokens are individual units of text prepared for analysis. In our case, we're looking at individual words, or 'unigrams'.\n\nWe should probabaly remove stop words. These are words don't really have much meaning in this context because of their ubiquity, like 'if', 'and' and 'but'. We can get rid of these by anti-joining a pre-prepared list of such words.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nye_words <- ye_lyrics %>%\n  unnest_tokens(word, line) %>%  # separate out tokens\n  anti_join(tidytext::stop_words)  # remove 'if', 'and', etc\n\nye_words %>%\n  sample_n(5) %>% \n  select(word, song_name) %>% \n  knitr::kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n| word | song_name |\n| :------ | :------ |\n| yesterday | Violent Crimes |\n| drop | I Thought About Killing You |\n| huh | Yikes |\n| publicly | Wouldn’t Leave |\n| drama’ll | Ghost Town |\n\nNote that this isn't completely successful. Kanye also uses colloquialisms and words like 'ima'; a contraction of two stop words that isn't represented in our stop-word dictionary.\n\n#### Count words\n\nNow we've tokenised the lyrics to removed stopwords, let's also show this as a plot. For simplicity, we'll show only the words that appeared more than five times.\n\nI've sampled even colours from the album cover of *ye*, stored as hexadecimal values in a named vector. We can select from these to decorate our plot, because why not. [The album cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/Ye_album_cover.jpg) is a Wyoming mountainscape, taken on Kanye's own iPhone shortly before he held a listening party for the new album. Scrawled in green lettering over the image is the phrase 'I hate being Bi-Polar it's awesome'.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nye_cols <- c(\n  mountain_blue = \"#233956\",\n  grass_blue = \"#0e1e27\",\n  cloud_blue1 = \"#7a8aa2\",\n  cloud_white = \"#dfd7c9\",\n  cloud_grey = \"#b5b2b0\",\n  cloud_blue2 = \"#9da3ae\",\n  text_green = \"#31ef56\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOkay, on with the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nye_words %>%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%  # tally words\n  filter(n > 5) %>%  # more than 5 occurrences \n  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%  # order by count\n  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = ye_cols[\"mountain_blue\"]) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Frequency of words in 'ye' (2018) by Kanye West\",\n    subtitle = \"Using the geniusr and tidytext packages\",\n    x = \"\", y = \"Count\",\n    caption = \"Lyrics from genius.com\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(  # apply ye theming\n    plot.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_white\"]),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_white\"]),\n    plot.caption = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_blue1\"]),\n    axis.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"text_green\"]),\n    axis.text = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"text_green\"]),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols[\"grass_blue\"]),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols[\"cloud_grey\"]),\n    panel.grid = element_line(ye_cols[\"cloud_grey\"])\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](resources/plot-freq.png){fig-alt=\"Bar plot of word frequency in Kanye West's 'ye' EP. The most frequent terms are 'love', 'yeah' and 'mhm' with 20 or more appearances.\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n### Bigrams\n\n#### Extract\n\nTokenising by individual words is fine, but we aren't restricted to unigrams. We can also tokenise by *bigrams*, which are pairs of adjacent words. For example, 'damn croissant' is a bigram in the sentence 'hurry up with my damn croissaint'.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nye_bigrams <- ye_lyrics %>%\n  unnest_tokens(\n    bigram,\n    line,\n    token = \"ngrams\",\n    n = 2\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nRemoving stopwords is tricker than for tokenising by word. We should tokenise by bigram first, then separate the words and match them to our stopword list.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nye_bigrams_separated <- ye_bigrams %>%\n  separate(bigram, c(\"word1\", \"word2\"), sep = \" \")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we can filter to remove the stopwords.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nye_bigrams_filtered <- ye_bigrams_separated %>%\n  dplyr::filter(\n    !word1 %in% stop_words$word,\n    !word2 %in% stop_words$word\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(bigram = paste(word1, word2))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe results look a bit like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nye_bigrams_filtered %>% \n  sample_n(5) %>% \n  select(bigram, song_name) %>%\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n:::\n\n\n| bigram | song_name |\n| :------ | :------ |\n| bleed yeah | Ghost Town |\n| fallin dreamin | Violent Crimes |\n| premeditated murder | I Thought About Killing You |\n| gonna leave | All Mine |\n| ayy i'ma | All Mine |\n\n#### Count bigrams\n\nSo let's plot the most frequent bigram occurrences, like we did for the single words\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nye_bigrams_filtered %>%\n  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%\n  filter(n > 3) %>%\n  mutate(bigram = reorder(bigram, n)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(bigram, n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = ye_cols[\"mountain_blue\"]) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Frequency of bigrams in 'ye' (2018) by Kanye West\",\n    subtitle = \"Using the geniusr and tidytext packages\",\n    x = \"\", y = \"Count\",\n    caption = \"Lyrics from genius.com\"\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_white\"]),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_white\"]),\n    plot.caption = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"cloud_blue1\"]),\n    axis.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"text_green\"]),\n    axis.text = element_text(colour = ye_cols[\"text_green\"]),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols[\"grass_blue\"]),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols[\"cloud_grey\"]),\n    panel.grid = element_line(ye_cols[\"cloud_grey\"])\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](resources/plot-bigrams.png){fig-alt=\"Bar plot of bigram frequency in Kanye West's 'ye' EP. The most frequent terms are 'mhm mhm', 'mistake girl' and 'menacin frigtenin' with 6 or more appearances.\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## What did we learn?\n\nIt's difficult to get a deep insight from looking at individual words from a 24-minute, seven-song album. You might argue that looking for deep insight from Kanye West's lyrics is a fool's errand anyway.\n\nDespite this, 'love' and 'feel' were in the top 10, which might indicate Kanye expressing his feelings. 'Bad', 'mistake' and 'pray' were also repeated a bunch of times, which might also indicate what's on Ye's mind. \n\nMost of the other most common words should probably have been removed as stop words but weren't in our stop-word dictionary (e.g. 'yeah', 'mhm', 'i'ma', 'gon', 'ayy', 'wanna'). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the flexibility of various swear words means they're pretty high up the list.\n\nWe've seen how simple it is to use the {geniusr} functions `search_artist()`, `get_artist_meta()`, `get_artist_songs()`, `get_songs_meta()` `and scrape_lyrics_url()` in conjunction with {purrr}, followed by some `tidytext`.\n\nThe next step might be to look at Ye's entire back catalogue and see how his lyrics have changed over time and how they compare to `ye` in particular.\n\nObviously I only made this post for the 'tid-ye-text' pun, so take it or leave it.\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-08-09 22:11:46 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.23    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.33     rlang_1.1.1       evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^1]: This is not a review of the album.
