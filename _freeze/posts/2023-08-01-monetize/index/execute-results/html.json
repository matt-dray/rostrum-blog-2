Developers rise up!\n\n## Free as in free\n\nThere's one good reason why SAS, SPSS and Stata[^r] are such successful and beloved statistical tools: money.\n\nFor some reason, R remains free and open source. But what if [Ihaka & Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) originally wanted users to be charged a literal (New Zealand) dollar[^nz] every time they use the `$` symbol to access an element from an object? I'm just asking the question!\n\nUs package developers should seize the initiative and harvest the sweet, sweet bounty of our labour. But how? I will tell you the secret!\n\n## Free as in not quite\n\nIntroducing the {monetize} R package! It will provide the inspiration you seek. Serious entrepreneurs can [install from GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/monetize)[^dont].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/monetize\")\nlibrary(monetize)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nWelcome to the monetize(TM) package FREE TRIAL version!\nTry our EXCLUSIVE add_one() function!\nTry watch_ad() to gain MEGA COINS and increase your MEMBER LEVEL for REWARDS!\nAnd now a quick message from our sponsor:\n  üßÉ IMBIBE ACME(TM)-BRAND FRUIT PULP (7% FEWER INSECT COMPONENTS)! ü™≥\n```\n\nThe package contains the exclusive `add_one()` function, which surprisingly doesn't come pre-installed with base R. A gap in the market!\n\nUsers should speculate to accumulate, so there's a small cost to use the function. In {monetize}, each use of a function costs 1 MEGA COIN.\n\nBecause I am so kind, I have chosen for users to receive a 30-day FREE TRIAL of the package and to receive 3 MEGA COINS as an exclusive NEW-MEMBER PERK.\n\nOne use of the function costs the low, low price of 1 MEGA COIN. Merely a small payment, or 'micro transaction', if you will.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_one(1)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nüìÖ You have 30 days left of your FREE TRIAL!\nüèÖ Your MEMBER LEVEL is 1! Try watch_ad()!\nüí∞ Your MEGA COIN balance is now 2! Try watch_ad()!\n[1] 2\n```\n\nAlong with the result, the function helpfully prints the number of days left in your FREE TRIAL, your MEMBER LEVEL and the number of MEGA COINS you have left.\n\nWhat's a MEMBER LEVEL? Well, at MEMBER LEVEL 1, the function can't guarantee a correct result. 20% of the time there'll be an off-by-one error. But R users index from 1 anyway, so they'll be used to that.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_one(1)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nüìÖ You have 30 days left of your FREE TRIAL!\nüèÖ Your MEMBER LEVEL is 1! Try watch_ad()!\nüí∞ Your MEGA COIN balance is now 1! Try watch_ad()!\n[1] 3\n```\n\nHow can you get the correct result 100% of the time? That's an exclusive for MEMBER LEVEL 2. How do you reach MEMBER LEVEL 2? What happens if you run out of MEGA COINS?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_one(1)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nüìÖ You have 30 days left of your FREE TRIAL!\nüèÖ Your MEMBER LEVEL is 1! Try watch_ad()!\nError: üò≠ You'll need more MEGA COINS to re-use this function! Try watch_ad()!\n```\n\nAnswer: simply watch some ads! I've managed to get an ad deal with the famous [Acme(TM) Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation). Maybe you could get a sponsorship deal from a third-party whose interests align with your users' interests; maybe SAS, SPSS or Stata would be interested?\n\nAnyway, the user can just `watch_ad()` in exchange for MEGA COINS: I've allowed the user to employ their FREE WILL to watch a `\"short\"` ad for 1 MEGA COIN or a `\"long\"` ad for 3 MEGA COINS.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwatch_ad(\"short\")\n```\n:::\n\n```\nüå≠ CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! üêï\nüå≠ CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! üêï\nüå≠ CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! üêï\nüå≠ CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! üêï\nüå≠ CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! üêï\nCongratulations! Your new MEGA COIN total is 1!\n```\n\nReach MEMBER LEVEL 2 after gaining 10 all-time MEGA COINS and MEMBER LEVEL 3 after 20 MEGA COINS.\n\nWhat's the exclusive MEMBER LEVEL 3? Well, you get the perk of an actually-correct answer like in MEMBER LEVEL 2... plus the value gets a randomised FREE HAT!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadd_one(1)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nüìÖ You have 30 days left of your FREE TRIAL!\nüèÖ Your MEMBER LEVEL is 3! Try watch_ad()!\nüí∞ Your MEGA COIN balance is now 19! Try watch_ad()!\nüé© \n 2 \n```\n\nWhat a tease! Oh, and the stats are persistent, so your users can't refresh their session and wipe the slate clean. Watch the cash roll in!\n\n## Free as in absolutely not\n\nI hope this has been an inspirational eye-opener for you and that one day you can be as rich as me. Oh, you didn't know I was rich? How else could I afford to keep this absolute juggernaut of a blog going?\n\nTo demonstrate how little I personally need them, here are some more ideas to maximise your financial rewards via R. You could try:\n\n* releasing version updates as paid add-ons, like [videogame DLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content) (you could also make them take several hours to download, like videogame DLC, which would definitely heighten the tension)\n* [loot boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box#Criticism) to allow users to gamble‚ÄîI mean, test their precognitive skills‚Äîfor new functionality (`add_two()` could be a common drop, while `multiply_by_two()` is ultra rare)\n* using certified financial guru [Duncan Garmonsway's {ggbillboard} package](https://github.com/nacnudus/ggbillboard) ('use vacant ggplot2 facets for advertising')\n\nYou are welcome. Don't read the small print for nerds.\n\n<details><summary>Small print for nerds.</summary>\nIt's a simple trick: up-to-date stats are stored on the user's computer in the directory resolved by `tools::R_user_dir(\"monetize\", \"data\")`[^ruserdir] and are updated each time you use the functions in the package. Easy to circumvent... if you know how.\n</details>\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-08-01 11:37:35 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] monetize_0.0.0.9000\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.23    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.33     rlang_1.1.1       evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^r]: Curious why they all start with 'S'?
