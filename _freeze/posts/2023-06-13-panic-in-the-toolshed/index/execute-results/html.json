My plea is small: I want public sector workers to share the tools they make[^open].\n\nWe should build modular things like R packages that are easy to use and develop; make them available to everyone to minimise duplication and encourage collaboration; and maximise reach by telling everyone about it. This is how we improve quality and build our community. And save money for the taxpayer. \n\nHandily, this is already expressed in the government's [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice):\n\n> Share, reuse and collaborate: avoid duplicating effort and unnecessary costs by collaborating across government and sharing and reusing technology, data, and services.\n\nI've had a small experience with this: I made [the {a11ytables} R package](https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/) to help producers of stats publications automate the creation of best-practice, accessible spreadsheets. It's now being used in several organisations and is referenced from [the government's best-practice guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/further-resources-for-releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/).\n\nSuccess? Maybe. But also PANIK: I've left the organisation where I made it; I was the sole developer; I worry that I should have thought about this sooner; that I should fork and update it; that updating users will be hard; that links to the old package will break; and so on. Hopefully people will learn something from these missteps.\n\n## Burying the hatchet\n\nThe slides are live [on the internet](https://matt-dray.github.io/government-toolshed/) and embedded below, or you can view [the source on GitHub](https://matt-dray.github.io/government-toolshed/#/section-1).

Maybe we could have a list of tools we've produced collectively in the public sector? Something like [an 'Awesome' list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) or a [CRAN task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). Maybe that would make it easier to find and develop existing solutions instead of building from scratch all the time.\n\nBuild a toolshed.

If you can't share the tool, then what can you tell people about the experience of developing and using it?\n",
