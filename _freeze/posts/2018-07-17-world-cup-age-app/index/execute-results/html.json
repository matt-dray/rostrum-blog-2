It's designed to make you feel old. You're welcome.\n\n## The World Cup Final\n\nSo the World Cup is over for another year. \n\nI managed luckily to get tickets for [the final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_CONIFA_World_Football_Cup), where [Karpatlya](http://www.conifa.org/en/members/karpatalya/)---a Hungarian diaspora in Ukraine---overcame the powerful [Northern Cyprus](http://www.conifa.org/en/members/northern-cyprus/) team on penalties at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Enfield, North London.\n\nAnother successful tournament from the [Confederation of Independent Football Associations](http://www.conifa.org/en/about-us/) (CONIFA).\n\n![Extremely rare and valuable tickets for the (CONIFA) World Cup final.](resources/tix.png){fig-alt=\"Two tickets to the CONIFA World Cup final.\" width=\"60%\" fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n## It didn't come home\n\nOh and also the far-less popular [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup) has also finished.\n\nWonderkid [Kylian Mbappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9) picked up the young player of the tournament as France lifted the trophy for the second time in their history.\n\nYes, 19-year-old Mbappé is young enough to have been born after France's last World Cup win in 1998. That makes me feel old.\n\nIt seems only yesterday that I was dreaming of starting alongside hall-of-famer Bermudan [Shaun Goater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Goater) in the extremely successful [Manchester City squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_Manchester_City_F.C._season) at the turn of the millennium.[^div1] (That reference probably dates me quite well.)\n\nObviously I can still make it as an elite footballer. Right? What better way to find out than to build an app with [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).\n\n## The app\n\nYou can clone [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/wc18-age) and run the app,[^shinyapps] or from an active R session you can run the following to download and run it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshiny::runGitHub(\"wc18-age\", \"matt-dray\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe app depends on the packages {shiny}, {shinythemes} and {DT}. I used the data set in the [AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads](https://github.com/AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads) GitHub repo, which contains player data scraped from Wikipedia by user [philstraforelli](https://github.com/philstraforelli).  \n\nThe app asks merely for your birth date---selectable from the dropdown menu---and calculates the number and percentage of players younger than you, with an interactive table that lists who they are.\n\n![](resources/wc18.png){fig-alt=\"A preview of the app, showing date of birth input, some text with calculation of your age and a table with the footballers who were younger than you.\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nA colleague suggested that wasn't enough punishment. So I updated it to tell you how many of the players you could be parent to (assuming you had them when you were age 18).\n\nHere's some solid reviews I've received so far:\n\n> Very depressing\n\n> I knew I was too old to become a great footballer\n\n> Just what I needed to see\n\nEnjoy! And take inspiration from [Kazuyoshi 'King Kazu' Miura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuyoshi_Miura), a Japanese 51-year-old (born 1967) who is still playing at time of writing. He's apparently just [played a match for Yokohama FC alongside 16-year-old Koki Saito](https://twitter.com/yokhin/status/1020981764276260864?s=21) (born 2001), who in theory is young enough to be his grandson!\n\n<div class=\"tip\"> \n`<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zm0-384c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24V264c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24s-24-10.7-24-24V152c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24zM224 352a32 32 0 1 1 64 0 32 32 0 1 1 -64 0z\"/></svg>`{=html} <b>Note</b>\n\nI re-rendered this post in 2023 and King Kazu is still playing aged 56!
