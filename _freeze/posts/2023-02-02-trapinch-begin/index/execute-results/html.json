Or, if you're fancy, it 'helps you deal programmatically with HTTP requests and responses' so you can use it to fetch data from [Application Programming Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (APIs).\n\n{httr2} has functions that are prefixed consistently (`req_*()`, `resp_()*`, etc), are narrow in scope, pipeable (`|>`) and which return nice errors and messages. These are neat improvements on [the original {httr} package](https://httr.r-lib.org/). \n\nI've used {httr} before to [explore R package startup messages](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/08/27/zzz/) and [detect linkrot](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/07/10/linkrot/). It's time to try out {httr2}. What simple API can I wrap into an R package?[^apis]\n\n## Poke an API\n\nRegular readers will be unsurprised that I've chosen [the PokéAPI API](https://pokeapi.co/) for fetching all sorts of information related to [the Pokémon game franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon).[^others]\n\nPokéAPI provides a [relatively simple API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). You don't need to sign-up or use API tokens, you can only read ('GET') data from it's not [rate-limited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting).\n\nURL paths for fetching data are also straightforward: you append an endpoint and a resource of interest to the base URL in the form `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/{endpoint}/{resource}`.[^exception]\n\nIn other words, you could type [`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/lotad`](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/lotad) in your browser and the API would respond with a JSON file containing data about [Lotad, the best Pokémon](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/2/2c/Lotad_PMRS.png).\n\n{httr2} lets us do this programmatically and can return a more R-friendly list object.\n\n## It's a trapinch\n\nSo, I've created [the {trapinch} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch).\n\nIt's a proof of concept; a work in progress. There's probably [bugs](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bug_(type)). I'm sharing it in case I don't take it any further, or if you want to contribute [an issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch/issues) or pull request. \n\nYou can download it from GitHub. It depends on {httr2} (obviously), [{rcurl}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RCurl) and R version 4.1 or higher[^version] and can be downloaded from GitHub:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/trapinch\")  # v0.0.1 in this post\nlibrary(trapinch)\n```\n:::\n\n\nDon't be surprised if function names or general functionality change in future. In particular, I'd like to look at [throttling](https://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch/issues/13) (limiting the number of API calls to prevent misuse) and to provide sensible errors for [timeouts](https://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch/issues/12) or if [the service is down](https://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch/issues/10).\n\n### Gotta GET 'em all\n\nThere's a generic low-level function, `get_pokeapi()`, to which you pass the `endpoint` and `resource` ID (numeric) or name (character) of interest. Each endpoint also has its own dedicated function, like `get_item()` or `get_move()` that calls `get_pokeapi()` under the hood.\n\nYou can look at the inbuilt `resource_lookups` list to get a dataframe of resource IDs and names for each endpoint, as well as the full URL needed to query the API. Here's the first few:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(names(resource_lookups))\n```\n:::\n\n```\n[1] \"ability\"        \"berry\"          \"berry-firmness\" \"berry-flavor\"  \n[5] \"characteristic\" \"contest-effect\"\n```\n\nSo here's the first few rows of the resource dataframe for the 'pokemon' endpoint:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(resource_lookups[[\"pokemon\"]])\n```\n:::\n\n```\n  id       name                                  url\n1  1  bulbasaur https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/\n2  2    ivysaur https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/\n3  3   venusaur https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/3/\n4  4 charmander https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4/\n5  5 charmeleon https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/5/\n6  6  charizard https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/6/\n```\nOne of these resource names is 'mew', [the legendary first-generation Pokémon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mew_(Pok%C3%A9mon)).[^mew] You could use `get_pokeapi(\"pokemon\", \"mew\")` to retrieve its data, or more simply:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmew <- get_pokemon(\"mew\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe function returns a list of lists, which is parsed from the JSON response returned by the API. So for the 'pokemon' endpoint we get 18 different elements of various classes:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(mew, max.level = 1)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nList of 18\n $ abilities               :List of 1\n $ base_experience         : int 300\n $ forms                   :List of 1\n $ game_indices            :List of 20\n $ height                  : int 4\n $ held_items              :List of 1\n $ id                      : int 151\n $ is_default              : logi TRUE\n $ location_area_encounters: chr \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/151/encounters\"\n $ moves                   :List of 363\n $ name                    : chr \"mew\"\n $ order                   : int 248\n $ past_types              : list()\n $ species                 :List of 2\n $ sprites                 :List of 10\n $ stats                   :List of 6\n $ types                   :List of 1\n $ weight                  : int 40\n```\n\nI've shown only the top level `str`ucture to hide some of the complexity. For example, the 'moves' item contains all the moves a Pokémon can learn, at what level it can learn them, in which game it learns them, and so on. Grabbing the first of the 363 'moves' items (!) listed for Mew looks like this (oof):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmew[[\"moves\"]][[1]][[\"move\"]][[\"name\"]]\n```\n:::\n\n```\n[1] \"pound\"\n```\n\nA future task might be to simplify some of this complexity by collapsing deep lists into dataframes where possible.\n\n### Thumbing the Pokédex\n\nThe API responses are 'paged', meaning that you must make successive requests of a set size to retrieve all the data for a given endpoint. The `get_*()` functions automatically expand the request to ask for all the items in one go. \n\nWe know the maximum number of items to be returned from an endpoint because the stored in the `resource_lookups` object, so this can be appended automatically to the request string. \n\n### BILL's PC\n\nResponses are cached, which means that the data is saved on your computer. If you make the same request, the data will be retrieved first from the cache rather than calling the API again. That means there's one less request for the API to deal with. \n\nThe cache is the path resolved by `R_user_dir(\"trapinch\", \"cache\")`. This function was introduced in R v4.0 for platform-independent storage of package-related data on a user's machine.[^ruserdir] You can delete everything from the cache with `clear_cache()`.\n\n### Substitute\n\n[{httptest2}](https://enpiar.com/httptest2/) is a handy package that lets you test code written with {httr2}, specifically.\n\nWhy would you need special testing for API calls? The idea is that you should be able to test your package without the need for an active internet connection. {httptest2} 'records' the calls you make when you run your tests, then chooses when testing between this 'mock' response and a 'live' response.\n\nThe approach is pretty simple if you've tested before with {testthat}: you wrap your normal `test_that()` call with `httr2::with_mock_dir()`. Here's an example of a test that make sure we get a list back from the API when we use `get_pokeapi()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith_mock_dir(\"endpoint\", {\n  test_that(\"a list is returned\", {\n    expect_type(get_pokeapi(\"move-battle-style\"), \"list\")\n  })\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\nBy wrapping the test in `with_mock_dir()`, {httptest2} creates the directory `tests/endpoint/` that stores a copy of the JSON returned for this call when an internet connection was live. \n\nAs an aside, I learnt about `curl::has_internet()` in [Colin's blogpost](https://colinfay.me/build-api-wrapper-package-r/), which can `stop()` the `get_*()` functions if there's no internet connection. But `has_internet()` will trigger if you're offline when you test, defeating the purpose of {httptest2}! Luckily, I saw [a timely post by Maëlle](https://blog.r-hub.io/2023/01/23/code-switch-escape-hatch-test/) about integrating this type of check into an 'escape hatch' so your unit tests can be run successfully in this scenario.\n\nThe [rOpenSci HTTP Testing book](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/) is a good general port of call as well.\n\n## Inside the Poké Ball\n\nThe user-facing functions of {trapinch} are therefore pretty simple. I could leave it at that.\n\nBut how daunting does the underlying {httr2} code look in the back-end? Turns out that it's not that scary, thanks to those friendly and modular functions of {httr2}.\n\nWe can walk through that earlier `get_pokemon(\"mew\")` call using bare {httr2} functions by:\n\n1. Starting with the base API URL\n2. Appending the endpoint and resource as extensions (i.e. in the form `/pokemon/mew`)\n3. Adding a query for the maximum number of items in this endpoint-resource combo (i.e. `?limit=1279`)\n4. Announcing to the API, as courtesy, who has made the call (i.e. who is the 'user agent')\n5. Specifying the cache location for results to be saved\n\nFirst some variables:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nendpoint <- \"pokemon\"\nresource <- \"mew\"\nbase_url <- \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/\"\nuser_agent <- \"trapinch (http://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch)\"\nresource_count <- nrow(trapinch::resource_lookups[[endpoint]])\ncache_dir <- tools::R_user_dir(\"trapinch\", which = \"cache\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd now we can build our request with {httr2} functions prefixed with `req`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(httr2)\n\nmew_request <- request(base_url) |>\n  req_url_path_append(endpoint, resource) |>\n  req_url_query(limit = resource_count) |>\n  req_user_agent(user_agent) |>\n  req_cache(cache_dir)\n```\n:::\n\n\nPrinting the object summarises the request:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmew_request\n```\n:::\n\n```\n<httr2_request>\nGET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/mew?limit=1279\nBody: empty\nOptions:\n• useragent: 'trapinch (http://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch)'\nPolicies:\n• cache_path: '/Users/mattdray/Library/Caches/org.R-project.R/R/trapinch'\n• cache_use_on_error: FALSE\n• cache_debug: FALSE\n```\n\nThen we can actually execute the request:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmew_perform <- req_perform(mew_request)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAgain, we can peek at the object to get some extra information about the processing of the request:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmew_perform\n```\n:::\n\n```\n<httr2_response>\nGET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/mew?limit=1279\nStatus: 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nBody: In memory (561317 bytes)\n```\nWe can see the request was successful, since the HTTP status was `200 OK`. Other [status values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are possible and may require us to try again later, for example.\n\nA couple of functions to mention here are `last_request()` and `last_response()`, which will also (surprise!) spit out info about the last request you made and the response received.\n\nFinally we can parse the JSON returned by the API. Again, I'm presenting the top-level `str`ucture only, given its complexity:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmew_response <- resp_body_json(mew_perform)\nstr(mew_response, max.level = 1)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nList of 18\n $ abilities               :List of 1\n $ base_experience         : int 300\n $ forms                   :List of 1\n $ game_indices            :List of 20\n $ height                  : int 4\n $ held_items              :List of 1\n $ id                      : int 151\n $ is_default              : logi TRUE\n $ location_area_encounters: chr \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/151/encounters\"\n $ moves                   :List of 363\n $ name                    : chr \"mew\"\n $ order                   : int 248\n $ past_types              : list()\n $ species                 :List of 2\n $ sprites                 :List of 10\n $ stats                   :List of 6\n $ types                   :List of 1\n $ weight                  : int 40\n```\n\nBoom: this matches the information we retrieved earlier with `get_pokemon(\"mew\")`.\n\n## Who's that Pokémon?\n\nI know you're thinking 'why trapinch?' In short, [it's the name of a Pokémon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trapinch_(Pok%C3%A9mon)) that contains the letters 'R API', which is cute. It also makes for an easy hex sticker with the Pokémon's characteristic zigzag mouth and colour palette of orange and grey.\n\nSo why not 'rapidash', which starts with 'R API'? Easy, lol: trapinch isn't taken yet on [Repokémon](https://cheeaun.github.io/repokemon/), a page by [Chee Aun](https://github.com/cheeaun) that lists GitHub repositories that are named after Pokémon.[^dialga]\n\n![](resources/trapinch-repokemon.png){fig-alt=\"A screenshot of a portion of the Repokémon webpage. It's an image of the Pokémon called trapinch. Underneath is its name and then the blurb, fork- and star-count for the matt-dray/trapinch GitHub repository.\" width=\"40%\"}\n\nJoin me next time as I continue my quest to write (sometimes) useful R packages that help me squat all the remaining spots on Repokémon (I call this 'RDD').[^rdd]\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-07-17 18:09:24 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.23    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.31     rlang_1.1.1       fontawesome_0.5.1 evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^apis]: There's [a GitHub repo with a big long list of free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) that you can try out.\n[^version]: This is entirely because I wanted to use `tools::R_user_dir()` for caching, which was introduced in v4.0.
