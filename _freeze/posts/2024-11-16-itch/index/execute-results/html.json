[It worked](https://mattdray.itch.io/little-pixel-fun-zone).\n\n## Scratching an itch.io\n\nWhere can you host your Shiny app for free? Typical options are services like [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) or [Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud/) by Posit.\n\nI have another idea: [itch.io](https://itch.io/) is a web-based platform known for hosting indie videogames, assets and other miscellaneous game-adjacent tools[^steam]. Developers can upload file bundles for users to download, or they can serve their HTML apps directly on the site.\n\nSince [R is a game engine](http://localhost:6375/posts/2023-04-02-splendid-r-games/)[^sick], why aren't R users uploading their apps to itch.io?\n\nWell, part of the problem is that you didn't know this was possible. And also because it's only recently that you can use [{shinylive}](https://shiny.posit.co/) to convert your app to be served entirely in the browser with no need for a server[^pages].\n\n`shinylive::export()` generates a folder containing your app and all the assets needed for deployment. You just need to zip it up and upload it to itch.io.\n\nWhich is [exactly what I did](https://mattdray.itch.io/little-pixel-fun-zone) with [a toy pixel editor](https://github.com/matt-dray/little-pixel-fun-zone/) that I made and [wrote about](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2024-09-15-shiny-pixel/) recently.\n\nThis requires an itch.io account. When you upload the app you fill in a short pro forma, making sure to set the 'kind of project' to HTML and to tick a checkbox to say 'this game will be played in the browser'. For my example, I also set the 'classification' to 'tools'.\n\nI can't really think of a catch, but there are limitations around size and complexity: the upload must be under 1 GB and I think there's a limit of 1000 files (this tripped me up when I tried once before).\n\n## Scratch my back\n\nI did this for the lols, of course, but I do think itch.io is a viable option for certain types of app. It's a platform for people to share their creativity and no-one cares what language was used if the outcome is fun or useful.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, you can also use itch.io as a payment platform. Users can leave you a little tip for your efforts.\n\nSo, what's stopping you from becoming the first professional indie R game developer?\n\n### Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2024-11-16 20:28:05 GMT\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.4.0 (2024-04-24)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.4.0    fastmap_1.2.0     cli_3.6.3.9000   \n [5] tools_4.4.0       htmltools_0.5.8.1 rstudioapi_0.16.0 yaml_2.3.10      \n [9] rmarkdown_2.28    knitr_1.48        jsonlite_1.8.9    xfun_0.48        \n[13] digest_0.6.37     rlang_1.1.4       evaluate_1.0.1   \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^pages]: Which makes it possible to deploy apps for free via static-site services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).\n[^steam]: Kinda like [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), but with a greater focus on independent developers and the rest of us.\n[^sick]: Are you sick of me saying this yet?",
