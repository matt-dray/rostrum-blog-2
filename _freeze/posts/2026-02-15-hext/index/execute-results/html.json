Charlie Gao's [{secretbase}](https://github.com/shikokuchuo/secretbase/blob/main/README.md)[^sb] has also joined the text revolution.\n\nThe spirit of these packages is minimalism. \nTheir logos match this aesthetic.\n\nSimplicity is a probably a good goal in general.\n\nSo, naturally, I have overengineered a simple thing to make it simple for you to not think about the complication behind such a simple thing.\n\n## Next: text hext\n\n[{hext}](https://github.com/matt-dray/hext) lets you write text-based logos.\n\nYou could install like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npak::pak(\"matt-dray/hext\")  # GitHub-only\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere is only one function: `hext()`.\nVery simple, very demure.\n\nHex outputs have four lines[^length].\nYou can add text and specify alignment for each of these.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhext::hext(\n  \"keep\", \"it\", \"simple,\", \"silly\",\n  \"left\", \"centre\", \"right\", \"left\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  ________\n /keep    \\\n/    it    \\\n\\   simple,/\n \\silly___/\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`hext()` handles character padding and line-length limits on your behalf.\nIt tries its best with Unicode (like emoji)[^render], but rendering is hard[^windows].\n\nThat's it, really.\n\n## Hexagone\n\nThink less, say less.\n\n### Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nLast rendered: 2026-02-22 21:01:02 GMT\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nR version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20\nRunning under: macOS Sequoia 15.6.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.5-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.5-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.12.1\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.5.1    fastmap_1.2.0     cli_3.6.5        \n [5] tools_4.5.1       htmltools_0.5.8.1 yaml_2.3.10       stringi_1.8.7    \n [9] rmarkdown_2.29    knitr_1.50        jsonlite_2.0.0    xfun_0.52        \n[13] digest_0.6.37     rlang_1.1.6       hext_0.1.0        evaluate_1.0.4   \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^craig]: You know who you are, dear one-user-who-isn't-me\n[^sb]: See-also the namesake YouTube channel for sports videos. And documentaries about the history of slipping on banana peels.\n[^base]: The irony being that the original iteration—called {hexbase}—was even simpler. Dependency-free, in fact.\n[^length]: The community seems divided on the number of characters per row. Like Charlie, I have opted for 8-10-10-8 top-to-bottom, which gives a little extra character space, even if makes the hexagon look a little more plump.\n[^render]: This works via `nchar(x, type = \"width\")` (or `stringi::stri_width()` if you have {stringi} installed), rather than the default `nchar(x, type = \"chars\")`. The smiley emoji has a width of `2`, but is `1` character long, for example. Obviously this impacts the whitespace padding that `hext()` needs to apply. If this is bothersome, you can use the argument `count_type` in `hext()` to switch between these counting modes.\n[^windows]: 'It may look ugly, especially on Windows', to quote Yihui's post. If your logo is borked somewhere then... c'est la vie.\n",
