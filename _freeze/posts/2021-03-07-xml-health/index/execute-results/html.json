This includes workouts linked from other apps, like [Nike Run Club](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app). I used the R packages [{xml2}](https://xml2.r-lib.org/index.html) and [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) to extract and clean my step counts and running activity.\n\n<div class=\"tip\"> `<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zm0-384c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24V264c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24s-24-10.7-24-24V152c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24zM224 352a32 32 0 1 1 64 0 32 32 0 1 1 -64 0z\"/></svg>`{=html} <b>Note</b>\n\nI revisited the theme of this post in 2023, but the format of the Apple Health download had changed. I updated the code needed to analyse the data and wrote [a new post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2023/06/11/apple-health-redux/).\n</div>\n\n## App storage\n\nMy healthcare provider peeks at [the Apple Health app](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/health/) and rewards me if I meet daily step-count targets. I know my usual pattern of steps has been disrupted since the start of COVID-19 lockdowns, [which began in the UK a year ago today](https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-lockdown-hancock-claim/).\n\nTo keep the step counter ticking over, I took up a new hobby on lockdown day one: running. I've recorded this activity on [the Nike Run Club app](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app), which I've linked to Apple Health.\n\nI've in excess of 99 problems and at least two of them are related specifically to these health data:\n\n1. I don't think my healthcare supplier is rewarding my step counts correctly and I need evidence[^duncan]\n1. It's not easy to get data out of the Nike Run Club app for further analysis\n\nLuckily, you can export the data---which is stored locally on your iPhone---including any workouts linked from other apps. It's provided as XML, which is a sensible, structured storage format, but not necessarily that familiar to the general R user.\n\nThis post looks at how to extract the data of interest and do something useful with it.\n\n## Warm up\n\nTo export activity data from the Health app (iOS 14.4):\n\n1. Open the Health app and tap your icon in the top right corner\n1. Scroll down and tap 'Export All Health Data'\n1. Tap 'Export' in the pop-up and the sharing tray will slide up for you to choose where to send the data\n\nYou'll get a zipped folder containing two XML files, `export_cda.xml` and `export.xml`, the latter of which contains your data. I stored and unzipped my folder locally for the purposes of this post.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemp <- tempdir()\nunzip(zipfile = \"~/Downloads/export.zip\", exdir = temp)\n```\n:::\n\n\nMy unzipped folder was about 140 MB and contained about 5 years of data. \n\nWe'll also need a few R packages. [The {xml2} package](https://xml2.r-lib.org/index.html) is on CRAN[^xml2] and has the tools you need to read and reshape XML files. It may be familiar if you've ever done any webscraping with R.[^scrape]\n\nWe'll also iterate to accumulate with [the {purrr} package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) and do the ol' wrangle-jangle with some [other tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(xml2)       # read and wrangle XML\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # {purrr}, {dplyr}, {ggplot2}, {forcats}\nlibrary(lubridate)  # date/time handling\n```\n:::\n\n\n## X-tract\n\nThe aptly named `xml2::read_xml()` function will let you read your `export.xml` file. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxml_in <- read_xml(file.path(temp, \"apple_health_export/export.xml\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere's a truncated view of the file's structure:\n\n\n::: {.cell out.lines='7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxml_in\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{xml_document}\n<HealthData locale=\"en_GB\">\n [1] <ExportDate value=\"2021-03-21 17:03:31 +0000\"/>\n [2] <Me HKCharacteristicTypeIdentifierDateOfBirth=\"\" HKCharacteristicTypeIde ...\n [3] <Record type=\"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount\" sourceName=\"MD’s phone\" ...\n [4] <Record type=\"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount\" sourceName=\"MD’s phone\" ...\n [5] <Record type=\"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount\" sourceName=\"MD’s phone\" ...\n....\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe object has the class `xml_document`. You can see metadata in the first few rows and then you can see the actual data is stored in a series of 'nodes'. Each record is an individual entry in our activity log and has attributes like `type` (e.g. step count), `sourceName` (i.e. the device name) and `unit` (e.g. a count).\n\nWe're interested in extracting data from two types of node:\n\n* `Record` for the step counts, as previewed above\n* `Workouts`, which is where the Nike Run Club app data is stored\n\nYou can extract specific parts of an XML file by reference to their [xpaths](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp), which are special regex-like strings that point to specific places in the document. The function `xml2::xml_find_all()` takes an xpath and returns the matching information.\n\nWe need only supply the simple high-level xpaths `//Record` and `//Workouts` for our needs. The forward slashes [read like](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp) 'select all the nodes in the document with the following name'.\n\nOnce extracted, we can get the attributes---like `type`, `sourceName`, etc---of each node using `xml2::xml_attr()`.\n\n## Step to it\n\nSo, let's grab all the 'record' nodes and preview the first one.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrecords <- xml_find_all(xml_in, \"//Record\")\nrecords[[1]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{xml_node}\n<Record type=\"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount\" sourceName=\"MD’s phone\" unit=\"count\" creationDate=\"2015-06-21 16:57:31 +0000\" startDate=\"2015-06-21 16:31:17 +0000\" endDate=\"2015-06-21 16:33:00 +0000\" value=\"28\">\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach record is a single 'bout' of activity as perceived by the app. You can see the first record is a step count from my phone on 21 June 2015, which lasted about two minutes and consisted of 28 steps.\n\nFor my purposes I only care about three attributes: the date[^time], the type of activity and the associated value. We can pass a named vector of each attribute to `xml2::xml_attr()` using `purrr::map_dfr()` to collate the output into a tidy rectangle.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrecords_df <- map_dfr(  # rowbind to dataframe\n  c(date = \"creationDate\", type = \"type\", steps = \"value\"),\n  ~xml_attr(records, .x)\n)\n\nglimpse(records_df)  # preview\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 487,590\nColumns: 3\n$ date  <chr> \"2015-06-21 16:57:31 +0000\", \"2015-06-21 16:57:31 +0000\", \"2015-…\n$ type  <chr> \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount\", \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierSt…\n$ steps <chr> \"28\", \"15\", \"44\", \"69\", \"80\", \"95\", \"1\", \"33\", \"41\", \"15\", \"24\",…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo what `type` of activity has been logged in the `Record` nodes?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npull(distinct(records_df, type))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount\"                     \n [2] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDistanceWalkingRunning\"        \n [3] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierActiveEnergyBurned\"            \n [4] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierFlightsClimbed\"                \n [5] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeadphoneAudioExposure\"        \n [6] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierWalkingDoubleSupportPercentage\"\n [7] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierWalkingSpeed\"                  \n [8] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierWalkingStepLength\"             \n [9] \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierWalkingAsymmetryPercentage\"    \n[10] \"HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSleepAnalysis\"                 \n[11] \"HKCategoryTypeIdentifierMindfulSession\"                \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI'm interested in step counts, so I'll isolate `HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount`, convert the date to datetime class and then summarise the number of steps per day. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrecords_out <- records_df %>% \n  filter(type == \"HKQuantityTypeIdentifierStepCount\") %>%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(date), steps = as.integer(steps)) %>%\n  group_by(date) %>%\n  summarise(steps = sum(steps), .groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    points = case_when(\n      steps > 12500 ~ 8L, steps > 10000 ~ 5L, steps > 7000 ~ 3L,\n      TRUE ~ 0L\n    )\n  )\n\nglimpse(records_out)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 2,094\nColumns: 3\n$ date   <date> 2015-06-21, 2015-06-22, 2015-06-23, 2015-06-24, 2015-06-25, 20…\n$ steps  <int> 647, 11273, 10071, 3586, 5206, 10362, 19036, 3980, 11850, 15937…\n$ points <int> 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8, 0, 5, 8, 3, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 3, 0, 8, 8, …\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI also created a new column that generates a 'points' value that my healthcare provider assigns to meeting certain step-count thresholds. Now I, tiny David, can sling this evidence into the eye of the behemoth cyclops that is my healthcare provider.\n\nI recommend checking first if the data look sensible, because my highest step count was apparently 10,692,175. I don't recall walking to Chicago and back to London on that day.\n\n### On a walkabout\n\nThere's so many ways you could investigate the step count data, like how frequency changes by day of the week or time of year, for example. \n\nHere's a quick exploration: how did my step-count frequency change in the year up to 23 March 2020---the announcement of the UK's first lockdown---and in the year since?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrecords_out %>% \n  mutate(\n    covid_year = case_when(\n      date >= \"2020-03-23\" & date < \"2021-03-23\" ~ \"Year post-lockdown\",\n      date >= \"2019-03-23\" & date < \"2020-03-23\" ~ \"Year pre-lockdown\", \n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(covid_year)) %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_histogram(aes(steps / 1000), binwidth = 1) + \n  facet_grid(~fct_rev(covid_year)) +\n  labs(x = \"Steps (thousands)\", y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/wo-plot-1.png){fig-alt='Side-by-side histograms of step counts before and after lockdown.

The second peak of the bimodal distribution has also fallen to a lower value with a more gradual tail. This is understandable: I used to walk on parts of my commute and lunchtimes, whereas my lockdown days have involved running or basically nothing.\n\n## Jog on\n\nNow let's look at the year's worth of running data from the `Workout` nodes of the XML.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nworkouts <- xml_find_all(xml_in, \"//Workout\")\nworkouts[[1]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{xml_node}\n<Workout workoutActivityType=\"HKWorkoutActivityTypeRunning\" duration=\"24.81425000031789\" durationUnit=\"min\" totalDistance=\"5.043024469383905\" totalDistanceUnit=\"km\" totalEnergyBurned=\"384.382\" totalEnergyBurnedUnit=\"kcal\" sourceName=\"Nike Run Club\" sourceVersion=\"2003161908\" creationDate=\"2020-03-23 08:01:39 +0000\" startDate=\"2020-03-23 07:36:45 +0000\" endDate=\"2020-03-23 08:01:39 +0000\">\n[1] <MetadataEntry key=\"HKIndoorWorkout\" value=\"0\"/>\n[2] <WorkoutEvent type=\"HKWorkoutEventTypePause\" date=\"2020-03-23 08:01:34 +0 ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe attributes are slightly different for workouts compared to records.

The histogram shows that most runs have been just above 5 km, with another peak just above 10 km. That makes sense: I intentionally set out to run at least these distances.\n\nAnother idea is that you you could use [the {calendR} package](https://github.com/R-CoderDotCom/calendR) to plot a calendar of your activity.[^duncanagain] Or you could do something more abstract: here's a 'run barcode' with a line per run for the full year.

The three black bands are the half-marathons; the white space (i.e. no runs) after the first of these indicates the rest my knees needed afterwards. There's a thick grey band after halfway, which is when I tried to run seven days in a row (the app is gamified and you get a special badge for doing that). You can also see how the pattern was more regular at the start, but I've since settled into a routine of just trying to fit in three runs and about 25 km per week.\n\n## Cool down\n\nSo the premise was quite simple: download your Apple Health data, read the XML file, extract the nodes of interest, wrangle lightly and present it. I've only done a basic exploration of the data, but there's so much more you could do.\n\nAfter starting this post, I noticed that [Mark Koester has written an in-depth post](http://www.markwk.com/data-analysis-for-apple-health.html) about Apple Health data, with a focus on Python code for achieving a similar goal. It notes third-party tools like [QS Access](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/qs-access/id920297614) for extracting data into a friendlier CSV format, for example.\n\nIt'll be interesting to revisit this in another year's time to see how a 'return to normality' (whatever that means) might impact these patterns of activity.\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-07-17 20:46:53 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n [1] patchwork_1.1.2 lubridate_1.9.2 forcats_1.0.0   stringr_1.5.0  \n [5] dplyr_1.1.2     purrr_1.0.1     readr_2.1.4     tidyr_1.3.0    \n [9] tibble_3.2.1    ggplot2_3.4.2   tidyverse_2.0.0 xml2_1.3.5     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] gtable_0.3.3      jsonlite_1.8.7    compiler_4.3.1    tidyselect_1.2.0 \n [5] scales_1.2.1      yaml_2.3.7        fastmap_1.1.1     R6_2.5.1         \n [9] labeling_0.4.2    generics_0.1.3    knitr_1.43.1      htmlwidgets_1.6.2\n[13] munsell_0.5.0     pillar_1.9.0      tzdb_0.4.0        rlang_1.1.1      \n[17] utf8_1.2.3        stringi_1.7.12    xfun_0.39         timechange_0.2.0 \n[21] cli_3.6.1         withr_2.5.0       magrittr_2.0.3    digest_0.6.31    \n[25] grid_4.3.1        rstudioapi_0.15.0 fontawesome_0.5.1 hms_1.1.3        \n[29] lifecycle_1.0.3   vctrs_0.6.3       evaluate_0.21     glue_1.6.2       \n[33] farver_2.1.1      fansi_1.0.4       colorspace_2.1-0  rmarkdown_2.23   \n[37] tools_4.3.1       pkgconfig_2.0.3   htmltools_0.5.5  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^duncan]: In this vein, you can also [use your Google Maps data to convince the church to marry you](https://nacnudus.github.io/duncangarmonsway/posts/2019-04-22-get-me-to-the-church-on-time-with-r-spatial/), as per Duncan Garmonsway.\n[^xml2]: '2' because it's a binding to [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/), but perhaps also because it's the spiritual successor to [{XML}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=XML), which is R's veteran package for XML handling.\n[^scrape]: For example, see previous posts about [travelling the NBA](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/12/24/nba-travel/) and [polite webscraping](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/03/04/polite-webscrape/).\n[^time]: Luckily, I live at +0000, so no time-related data wrangling is required for me.\n[^duncanagain]: Another reference to [Duncan's post](https://nacnudus.github.io/duncangarmonsway/posts/2019-04-22-get-me-to-the-church-on-time-with-r-spatial/).\n",
