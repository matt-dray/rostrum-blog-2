First and foremost, do it for you.\n\n## Why blog?\n\nI've stumbled into writing 50 posts on this blog. There was no plan. I have no strategy. It's working so far.\n\nMy only regret was not starting sooner. How would I convince me-from-the-past?\n\n1. It's your [reference library](#reference-library)\n1. It only has to be [good enough](#good-enough)\n1. There are others [like you](#like-you)\n\nI'll explain.\n\n### 1. It's your reference library {#reference-library}\n\nI forget everything. That's especially true for code. \n\nKeeping a written record of what you've learnt is a good way of storing that information outside of your head.\n\nWriting a narrative will help explain the code and make sure you understand it in your own words. That'll make it easier to pick up later.\n\nIt helps if what you write is available to you everywhere all the time as well. It needs to be open and on the internet.\n\nProof is in the pudding: I've lost count of the number of times I've referred back to my own posts on [creating an R package](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/11/01/usethis/), [web scraping](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/03/04/polite-webscrape/) and [fixing leaky pipes](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/04/07/fix-leaky-pipes/), for example. \n\nFor me, 'blog or it didn't happen' is probably a good mantra.\n\n### 2. It only has to be good enough {#good-enough}\n\nPerfectionism is cruel and returns are diminishing. I sat on a thesis for months longer than I should have. Did it improve in that time? Marginally. Did it affect the outcome? Not really.\n\nThe spell was broken when someone told me that 'it only has to be good enough'.\n\nYou have finite time and too much stuff to do, so maybe efficiency should be the focus. There's a real, obtainable, minimum level of effort that will get you to a thing that works.\n\nConsider that in the context of writing blog posts _for yourself_. They only have to be good enough to remind _you_ of what you did so you can redo the thing at some point in the future.\n\nThis will also encourage you to keep it short and simple. You're far more likely to finish it that way. Write a follow-up later if you want to.\n\n### 3. There are others like you {#like-you}\n\nR solves so many problems efficiently and reproducibly. It's particularly needed in the public sector, where I work, to build trust, reduce costs and do things quicker. I think there are plenty of people in this boat; why else are you reading this?\n\nI'm not a 'programmer', however. I wasn't specifically trained in statistics. I definitely didn't 'get' R at first and I'm probably never going to be an 'expert'. So I might as well keep learning and sharing.\n\nBeing visible with your learning means that others can help you and give you ideas. Being open might even encourage other learners to get involved, too.\n\nConsider people like [Sharla Gelfand](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand) and [David Keyes](https://twitter.com/dgkeyes) (of [R for the Rest of Us](https://rfortherestofus.com/)), who are visible on Twitter and unafraid of asking questions. One of R's unique selling points is its friendly community. Make the most of it.\n\nUltimately, you don't owe anything to anyone. But there are other people like you. Why not learn in the open and help lower the barrier to entry?\n\n## More reasons\n\nI think this would be enough to convince me-from-the-past, but maybe it's not enough for you.\n\nAfter I started writing this I came across [Rebecca Barter](https://twitter.com/rlbarter)'s nice talk on [Becoming an R Blogger](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/rebecca-barter) at the recent RStudio Conference. Rebecca has also written [a supporting blog post](http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-02-03_blogger/) with some helpful information.\n\nIn particular, Rebecca mentions some reasons beyond 'doing it for yourself', like building up a portfolio of work, gaining exposure and squeezing some productivity into your procrastination. All extremely valid.\n\nTry it and let me know how it goes.\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-07-22 16:10:55 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.23    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.33     rlang_1.1.1       evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^ref]: [Public Domain](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WPA-Printing-Class-1937.jpg).",
