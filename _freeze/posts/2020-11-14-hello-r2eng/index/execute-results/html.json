Inspired by [Amelia McNamara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckW9sSdIVAc) and with a huge amount of help from [Chung-hong Chan](https://twitter.com/chainsawriot).\n\n## Communication is hard\n\nAmelia McNamara ([site](http://www.amelia.mn/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN)) gave a talk at the useR! 2020 conference called 'Speaking R'. Watch the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckW9sSdIVAc), or take a look at the [slides](https://www.amelia.mn/SpeakingR/#1).\n\nTo summarise greatly: R code should be speakable so that we can teach, learn and communicate with minimal friction.\n\n'Speakable' means I should be able to read an R expression to you as an English sentence (rather than reading out individual characters) and we should be able to understand each other.\n\nBut this is all easier said than... said.\n\nIdeally we'd have an agreed dictionary that maps each R token to an equivalent English phrase. But there will always be variation between users and across communities; between beginners and aficionados; and given differences in spoken language.\n\nThen there's context. We might agree that the operator `%>%` is called a 'pipe', but you might say the word 'then' when reading an expression. So `data %>% print()` might be spoken as 'data _then_ print'.\n\nThe order of parsing may also differ between people. Something as simple as `x <- 1` could be 'x gets 1', 'assign the value 1 to the variable named x', or something else entirely. Now imagine that on the scale of an entire script.\n\nI don't think we can completely 'solve' any of this, but we could probably develop the conversation with the help of a tool accessible from R itself.\n\n## Hello {r2eng}\n\nThis is where the {r2eng} package comes in. The goal is to take an R expression and translate it to an equivalent speakable, English sentence, from within R itself.\n\nThe initial focus has been to:\n\n* concentrate on translating to English (I'm biased)\n* map the most common R operators (e.g. assignment, maths, brackets)\n* use commonly-used (but currently opinionated[^paren]) English translations for R operators ('gets' for `<-`)\n* work on a simple one-to-one, left-to-right mapping of R to English\n* keep the API simple, so you just supply an expression and get a result\n* simply _begin_ an approach to address what was raised in Amelia's presentation \n\nObviously the package is not finished, let alone perfect, and it requires more theoretical and practical considerations to make it truly useful. Clearly I don't have all the answers and I'm certainly not an arbiter of language, but I think the purpose is defined and it certainly works for simple cases.\n\nAt worst, I hope the package will encourage discussion. There's been some interest on Twitter and [on the RStudio Community site](https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-do-you-speak-r/73727), but do consider contributing thoughts and ideas to [the {r2eng} GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng).\n\nIn this vein, it's important to highlight Chung-hong Chan's valuable contributions to the package. Check out his [website](http://chainsawriot.com/) and find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chainsawriot). Chung-hong was responsible for updating {r2eng} to handle [non-standard evaluation](https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng/commit/c38e0a44a785f3ac10dfd7a9302cf3f77091ba55) in the `translate()` function and for replacing my original simple R-to-English lookup with a proper [parsing method](https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng/commit/dcbfa08a7b7798a76c6c7101c9c152b1a3ccb77f) for interpreting R expressions. \n\n### Installation\n\nYou can install the package from GitHub using the {remotes} package. The package is in development version 0.0.0.9005 at the time of writing and this post discusses functionality for that version. Things may change.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")  # if not already installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/r2eng\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### How it works\n\n#### Recognising tokens\n\nThe secret sauce of the package is that it recognises the 'tokens' that make up an R expression. So the assignment operator, `<-`, is recognised as a single token rather than the less-than (`<`) and hyphen (`-`) characters typed sequentially.\n\nThis power is brought to {r2eng} thanks to [{lintr}](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr), a package by [Jim Hester](https://www.jimhester.com/) that assesses your code for possible errors and style improvements.\n\nAn important part of this process is parsing R expressions and recognising tokens using the `lintr::get_source_expressions()` function. For example, that `<-` operator is recognised as the special token `LEFT_ASSIGN` under the hood.\n\nThis is some deep R magic. You can see a [special grammar file](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/gram.y) file in the R source code that [carries these mappings](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/gram.y#L2092-L2127).[^acraig]\n\nPut simply, {r2eng} hijacks this process, adds a step that maps each token to English terms, then recombines the text into a sentence.\n\n#### Speech\n\nBy default, {r2eng} will translate an R expression and then your computer will speak it out loud.\n\nThis is relatively straightforward on a Mac: the resulting English text is handed to your machine with a `system()` call and is vocalised by the built-in VoiceOver text-to-speech converter. This functionality is not built into Windows by default, so the `system()` call fails silently.\n\nOf course, this assumes that VoiceOver will do a good job of parsing the English expression from {r2eng}, but that isn't guaranteed because of issues like localised pronunciation and uncommon words. I've written before about how [text-to-speech isn't necessarily that good at recognising R package names](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/09/20/say-package/), for example.\n\nIn theory, and assuming that the translation gets good, {r2eng} could be used as a simple accessibility tool because it can interpret R-specific tokens in a way that VoiceOver cannot.\n\n### Using {r2eng}\n\nYou can find further examples in [the package README](https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng/blob/master/README.md), but I'll explain here the main functionality.\n\nFirst I'll attach the package after having installed it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(r2eng)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### The `translate()` function\n\nThere are two main functions in {r2eng}: `translate()` and `translate_string()`. They convert from a bare or quoted R expression, respectively, to English.\n\n`translate()` takes advantage of non-standard evaluation: you pass bare (i.e. unquoted) R code to the `expression` argument and a few things happen.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntranslate(data <- 1 + 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOriginal expression: data <- 1 + 1\nEnglish expression: data gets 1 plus 1 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst, it prints both the original R expression and the corresponding English translation. Second, and only if you are using macOS, the English string is passed to a system command that vocalises the string.\n\nHere's a more complex example using some {dplyr} functions. Note that we don't need to attach {dplyr} to be able to translate.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntranslate(\n  data %>% select(x, y) %>% dplyr::filter(y == \"example\"),\n  function_call_end = \"\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOriginal expression: data %>% select(x, y) %>% dplyr::filter(y == \"example\")\nEnglish expression: data then select open paren x , y close paren then dplyr double-colon filter open paren y double equals string \"example\" close paren\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote the `function_call_end` argument in this example. The default is `\"of \"`, which would would have made the translation `data then select of open paren x y close paren`, etc. Feedback suggested that this was how some users spoke the English translation out loud, so the functionality has been included for now.\n\nWhile `translate()` takes a bare expression, `translate_string()` takes a string.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(magrittr)  # attach for pipes\n\"data<-1+1\" %>%\n  translate_string(speak = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOriginal expression: data <- 1 + 1\nEnglish expression: data gets 1 plus 1 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe get the same sort of output as the `translate()` example, but this time I set the `speak` argument to `FALSE` to stop the English text from being 'spoken' by my computer and I also eliminated spaces from the input to demonstrate that they're ignored.\n\n#### r2eng objects\n\nOf course, you can assign a translation to an object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_translation <- \n  translate(data <- 1 + 1, speak = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe object is a special `r2eng` S3 class of object, which is also a list.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclass(my_translation)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"list\"  \"r2eng\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can apply some methods to such an object: `print()`, `speak()` and `evaluate()`.\n\nPrint the object to see that custom console output again:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(my_translation)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOriginal expression: data <- 1 + 1\nEnglish expression: data gets 1 plus 1 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRe-call the system command that 'speaks' the R expression out loud (again, only on macOS).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspeak(my_translation)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd you can actually evaluate the R expression you supplied to `translate()` in the first place. So the expression we supplied, `data <- 1 + 1`, is evaluated so that calling `data` gives us the result of `1 + 1`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nevaluate(my_translation)\ndata\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### r2eng-class list elements\n\nYou can also access the R expression, the English translation and the mapping between them as elements of your `r2eng` list object.\n\nHere's the R expression again:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_translation$r_expression\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"data <- 1 + 1\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd the translated output:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_translation$eng_expression\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \" data gets 1 plus 1 \"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd a `data.frame` object that contains the mapping.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap <- my_translation$translation_map\nmap[map$text != \"\", ]  # filter out text spaces\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n        token text  eng\n1      SYMBOL data data\n2 LEFT_ASSIGN   <- gets\n4   NUM_CONST    1    1\n6         '+'    + plus\n7   NUM_CONST    1    1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis element is a good summary of what {r2eng} is doing under the hood: it breaks the R expression into recognised tokens and maps words to them where it knows what the corresponding English for that token should be. So `<-` is recognised as the token `LEFT_ASSIGN`, which is mapped internally to the English text `gets`.\n\n### Bonus material\n\n#### RStudio Addin\n\nThe `print()` and `speak()` functions can be accessed via an RStudio addin that's installed with the package (you may need to restart RStudio after installation). To use them, highlight an R expression in your script and select from the RStudio addins menu:\n\n* 'Speak R Expression In English' to vocalise the expression through your computer's speakers (macOS only)\n* 'Print R Expression In English' to output an English translation to the console\n\nThese can be mapped to keyboard shortcuts so you can highlight and translate quickly without specifically calling `translate()` and `print()` or `speak()`.\n\n#### Binder demo\n\nMaybe you don't want to install the package. That's fine. Instead, you can try out the package by opening this [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) instance of RStudio with {r2eng} and the tidyverse pre-installed. Click this badge to launch it: \n\n[![](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg){fig-align=\"left\"}](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/matt-dray/try-r2eng/master?urlpath=rstudio)\n\nThe downside is that you can't use the speak method. Make sure to set the argument `speak = FALSE` in `translate()` or `translate_string()`, or you'll get a warning message when you run your code.\n\nYou can find the source for this at the [try-r2eng](https://github.com/matt-dray/try-r2eng) GitHub repo and you can [read one of my posts](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/08/25/holepunch-drake/) on how to set up Binder using [Karthik Ram's {holepunch} package](https://karthik.github.io/holepunch/).\n\n## There's lots to do\n\nAs mentioned, this is really just the beginning.\n\nThere's plenty of room for simple improvements, as well as some long term possibilities. For example, we could:\n\n* expand the list of R tokens that can be translated\n* allow for context-dependent translation where the same token can be used for more than one application\n* do user-research to find out the most common English terms used\n* provide instructions to make the speak method possible on non-Mac platforms\n* include full script awareness so that we aren't limited by left-to-right interpretation\n* expand the package for non-English languages, or create {r2es}, {r2fr}, etc\n* etc\n\nHopefully we can work on some of these things and this won't be the last post about {r2eng} on this blog. In the meantime, do consider contributing to [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng).\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2024-07-14 20:38:54 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.4.0 (2024-04-24)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] magrittr_2.0.3   r2eng_0.0.0.9006\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.4.0    fastmap_1.2.0     cli_3.6.3.9000   \n [5] tools_4.4.0       htmltools_0.5.8.1 rstudioapi_0.16.0 yaml_2.3.8       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.26    knitr_1.46        jsonlite_1.8.8    xfun_0.43        \n[13] digest_0.6.35     rlang_1.1.4.9000  evaluate_0.23    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details><p>\n\n[^paren]: A good example of opinionated word choice is this character: `(`.
