[I made the function `tide::tide()`](https://github.com/matt-dray/tide) to generate automatically some code that will reproduce the changes you made manually with `edit()`.\n\n## Edit\n\nR's `edit()` function invokes a text editor so you can amend an R object.[^tweet]\n\nSomething special happens If you `edit()` a data.frame object: a somewhat-janky interactive spreadsheet-like editor appears in a new window.[^platform]\n\nClick in a cell to amend a value, or click in the header for a menu that lets you change the column name, or switch between real and character classes. There are even buttons to copy and paste values.\n\nClick the 'quit' button to confirm your changes. The edited data is returned to you back in the console.\n\nBut [that's not very reproducible](https://twitter.com/TrevorABranch/status/1518420680491945984?s=20&t=X0VR706pMtDQrUMLn_YHoA). How can anyone recreate the amended dataframe from the original if your clicks and keypresses weren't recorded? \n\nCan we make `edit()` more reproducible?\n\n## Tide\n\nBasic premise: [create a function](https://github.com/matt-dray/tide/blob/main/R/tide.R) that accepts a dataframe as input, opens the edit menu, observes the updated values and generates code to reproduce the new object from the old.\n\n[I've created the concept package, {tide}, to do this](https://github.com/matt-dray/tide).[^concept] It has only one, eponymous function: `tide()`.\n\nWhy 'tide'? Well, it's 'edit' backwards. And we're 'turning the tide' on the `edit()` function to make it reproducible, geddit?[^canute]\n\nYou can install {tide} from GitHub. [The {clipr} package](http://matthewlincoln.net/clipr/), which can copy text to your clipboard, will also be installed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!require(remotes)) install.packages(\"remotes\")\ninstall_github(\"matt-dray/tide\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo let's get our feet wet with an example. Here's a thematically-related data.frame of [the tide table for London Bridge](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast-and-sea/tide-tables/2/113) for May 1 2022.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntide_table <- data.frame(\n  type = c(\"High\", \"Low\", NA_character_, \"Low\"),\n  time_bst = c(\"02:58\", \"09:42\", \"15:20\", \"21:58\"),\n  height_m = c(7.0, 0.5, 6.9, 70)\n)\n\ntide_table\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  type time_bst height_m\n1 High    02:58      7.0\n2  Low    09:42      0.5\n3 <NA>    15:20      6.9\n4  Low    21:58     70.0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut whoops: the missing value should be 'High' and the height is wrong by two orders of magnitude for the 21:58 low tide.\n\nSo, let's use `tide::tide()` on the dataframe to edit those values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tide)\ntide(tide_table)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis opens a separate data-editor window. Here's how it looks when it opens:[^platform]\n\n\n![](resources/editor.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of a very simple spreadsheet editor with some edits to be made. There are buttons for copy, paste and quit.\" width=\"50%\"}\n\nAnd once I've made the adjustments manually:\n\n![](resources/editor2.png){fig-alt=\"Screenshot of a very simple spreadsheet editor after some edits have been made. There are buttons for copy, paste and quit.\" width=\"50%\"}\n\nAnd here's what's returned to the console once I've clicked the 'Quit' button:\n\n```\nWrote code to clipboard\n##   type time_bst height_m\n## 1 High    02:58      7.0\n## 2  Low    09:42      0.5\n## 3 High    15:20      6.9\n## 4  Low    21:58      0.7\n```\n\nYou can see the edits have been successfully returned. This is also what you'd see if you just used `edit()`.\n\nThe extra feature from `tide()` is evident in the message `Wrote code to clipboard`: the function generated some lines of code that will take you from the original to the edited object.\n\nSo if we now paste from the clipboard we get:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntide_table[3, 1] <- \"High\"\ntide_table[4, 3] <- 0.7\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn other words, 'replace the value in row 3, column 1 of the `tide_table` object with the string value `\"High\"`', for example.\n\nAnd if we actually run those lines, we can recreate the amended data.frame from the original:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntide_table\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  type time_bst height_m\n1 High    02:58      7.0\n2  Low    09:42      0.5\n3 High    15:20      6.9\n4  Low    21:58      0.7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, hurrah, we now have a method of manually editing the table and getting some code back that can reproduce it.\n\n## Diet\n\nTo borrow another anagram of 'edit' the capability of the package is quite... lightweight. [Some issues](https://github.com/matt-dray/tide/issues) are that:\n\n* the function currently only works if you amend individual values (cells), not if you change headers, or add rows and columns\n* the returned code will operate on a cell-by-cell basis, so you might get `x[1, 1] <- \"A\"` and `x[2, 1] <- \"B\"` where actually it could have been the more convenient to get `x[1:2, 1] <- c(\"A\", \"B\")`\n* the returned code refers to columns by index, even though it's more explicit to refer to them by name, like `x[1, \"col1\"] <- \"A\"`\n* the returned code will be written in base R and will edit in place by index (i.e. `[<-`), it doesn't return {data.table}- or tidyverse-compliant code\n* you only get the code in your clipboard, it isn't returned from the function\n\nI might update the package to handle this stuff in future, or [you can do it for me with a pull request in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/tide).\n\nBut to be honest, the data editor is probably a bit too clunky and simple to be useful for most use cases. So there's not much point expanding this package beyond a concept.\n\nOr maybe the approach will pick up pace like [the Severn Estuary tidal bore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severn_bore), who knows? Or maybe you think this post is a bore.[^puns]\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-07-02 12:36:29 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.14   yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.22    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.5    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.31     rlang_1.1.1       evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^tweet]: I think this was new to quite a lot of people, based on [a recent tweet I wrote about it](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1518374831993069570?s=20&t=X0VR706pMtDQrUMLn_YHoA). The `edit()` function feels like another one of those 'hidden' base functions. There's not really a good reason for you to know about it unless someone told you about it. I got it from an old-school textbook when first learning R, just like the `locator()` function for retrieving interactively the coordinates from a plot, which [I wrote about in a previous post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/11/04/kanto-locator/).\n[^concept]: 'Concept' means I can put it out there without any guarantees or polish, and I don't even have to complete it if I don't want to!\n[^puns]: You came here for the wordplay anyway, right?\n[^canute]: Also consider the allusion to [King Canute trying to turn back the tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Canute_and_the_tide). It can be pretty hard to stop people writing non-reproducible code. And this package isn't going to change that.\n[^platform]: Note that the help for `?dataentry`, which underlies `edit()`, says 'the data entry editor is only available on some platforms and GUIs' and 'the details of interface to the data grid may differ by platform and GUI'.\n",
