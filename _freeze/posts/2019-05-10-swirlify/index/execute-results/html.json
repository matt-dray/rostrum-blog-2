You should take a look at [swirl-tidy by Seo-young Silvia Kim](https://github.com/sysilviakim/swirl-tidy) instead.\n</div><p>\n\n## Swirl\n\n[Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) is a platform that:\n\n>teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console!\n\nLearning with Swirl is active and your understanding is checked throughout. You can move at your own pace and download additional courses to learn about new things. And it's free.\n\nInstall and load Swirl to begin and then follow the instructions printed in the console.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\")\nlibrary(swirl)\nswirl()\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere's what the first few lines of interaction with Swirl look like.\n\n![](resources/swirl-startup-console.png){fig-alt=\"The R console showing input to Swirl and some responses, like Swirl asks 'What shall I call you?' and 'Matt' has been input.\"}\n\nYou'll be given a list of courses to install, but you can also download them from elsewhere. This post is about how you can quickly create and distribute such a course.\n\n## Swirlify\n\nSean Kross and Nick Carchedi have created [the {swirlify} package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=swirlify) to make course creation easy. This post covers a simple workflow to get you started, but [full Swirlify guidance](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/) is available. \n\n### Get up and running\n\nCreate a new lesson folder (‘Lesson 1’), which will be autopopulated with template files for your lesson. This will also create a new parent course folder (‘New Course’) if it doesn’t already exist.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(swirl)  # install.packages(\"swirl\")\nlibrary(swirlify)  # install.packages(\"swirlify\")\nnew_lesson(course_name = \"New Course\", lesson_name = \"Lesson 1\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe following folder structure is generated:\n\n```\nWorking directory/\n└── New_Course/\n    └── Lesson_1/\n        ├── customTests.R\n        ├── dependson.txt\n        ├── initLesson.R\n        └── lesson.yaml\n```\n\nThe `lesson.yaml` file is the most important one. It's basically a text file where each question is stored as text. Users advance through each of these questions when they run the lesson. \n\nThe lesson file can be edited directly, but we'll focus on the built-in Swirlify Shiny app for simplicity:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nswirlify(course_name = \"New Course\", lesson_name = \"Lesson 1\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe app will open the named lesson from the named course in a new browser window. On the left is where you create new questions. On the right you can see the `lesson.yaml` file itself. \n\n![](resources/swirlify-start.png){fig-alt=\"The Swirlify Shiny GUI for writing lessons, showing a dropdown box for the lesson type, a box for writing output, the YAML code for the lesson so far, and buttons for saving and demoing the code.\"}\n\nNote the 'Help' tab, which tells you about the types of questions you can make, or you can see the [Swirlify guidance](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/writing.html#types_of_questions)). Basically the question types are:\n\n* 'message' for informational text (not for questions per se)\n* 'command' for answers that require simple R expressions as answers\n* 'numerical' and 'text' for answers that are numbers or words\n* 'multiple choice' for multiple choice (as in the figure above)\n* 'figure' and 'video' for referring to media ('video' can take a user to any URL)\n* 'script' for longer R expressions that requires you to write custom answer tests (this is more advanced)\n\nTo build a question:\n\n1. Choose a question type from the dropdown menu on the left\n1. Fill in the text boxes (note that the answer tests box is completed for you if you type into the correct answer box and then press the 'Make Answer Test from Correct Answer' button)\n1. Click the 'Add Question' button see the question added to the file (on the right hand side)\n1. Click 'Save Lesson'\n1. Run `test_lesson()` to look for errors\n1. Click 'Demo Lesson' to try it out\n\n![](resources/swirlify-demo.gif){fig-alt=\"A gif showing the process of creating a question with Swirlify's Shiny GUI, adding it to the YAML for the lesson and then saving it.\"}\n\nContinue adding questions until the lesson is complete. Then:\n\n1. Run `add_to_manifest()` to add the lesson to the `MANIFEST` file (it'll be created in the course directory if it doesn't already exist). Lessons in here are recognised as part of the course in the declared order.\n1. Use `new_lesson()` to create a new one, remembering to change the `lesson_name` argument and also add this lesson to the MANIFEST as well.\n\nYou should end up with a folder structure like this:\n\n```\nWorking directory/\n└── New_Course/\n    ├── Lesson_1/\n    |   ├── customTests.R\n    |   ├── dependson.txt\n    |   ├── initLesson.R\n    |   └── lesson.yaml\n    ├─ Lesson_2/\n    |   ├── customTests.R\n    |   ├── dependson.txt\n    |   ├── initLesson.R\n    |   └── lesson.yaml\n    └─ MANIFEST\n```\n\nWhen your lessons are completed, you're ready to share your course. Jump now to the [share your course](#share) section or first learn some extra knowledge about [lesson file structure](#structure), [correct answers](#correct) or [lesson startup](#startup) below.\n\n### Extra knowledge\n\nClearly the process of course building is more nuanced than outlined above, but you can learn more from the documentation on the [Swirlify](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/index.html) site and [reference manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/swirlify/swirlify.pdf). In particular, See the [course structure](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/structure.html) and [writing lessons](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/writing.html) pages of the Swirlify guidance.\n\nI'll touch on three things here: lesson file structure, correct answers and lesson start-up.\n\n#### Lesson file structure {#structure}\n\nThe lesson file is written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), which is basically a special form of plain text. Questions appear as separate blocks of text that start with a hyphen and a question type (class) declaration, followed by further arguments on new indented lines.\n\nThe first block is always `Class: meta` and provides basic information about the file, like your name and the lesson name. Another simple one is `Class: text` to which you supply only one more argument, the `Output`, which is text to display to the user.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n- Class: text\n  Output: Did I mention chocolate hobnobs are great?\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are actually three ways to add questions:\n\n1. In the Shiny app, as outlined earlier in this post.\n1. By using the `wq_*()` family of functions to add questions to the active lesson -- `wq_message(output = \"Text here\")` adds informative text, for example.\n1. By writing directly into the YAML file.\n\nThere's more on questions classes and how to write them [in the Swirlify guidance](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/writing.html#types-of-questions).\n\n#### Correct answers {#correct}\n\nHow are answers encoded and checked in `lesson.yaml`? Consider the YAML for this question:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n- Class: cmd_question\n  Output: Use mean() to calculate the mean of the numbers 1 to 5.\n  CorrectAnswer: mean(1:5)\n  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(1:5'))\n  Hint: Use the form x:y to provide numbers to mean().\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo `CorrectAnswer` is where you provide the correct answer (!). This line will be run if the user chooses to `skip()` the question. `AnswerTests` is, however, what the user's input will actually be evaluated against. It uses the `omnitest` function to compare the correct expression (`correctExpr`) to the user's answer.\n\nBut often there's more than one way to answer. The `any_of_exprs()` function should be used in this case.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n- Class: cmd_question\n  Output: Use mean() to calculate the mean of the numbers 1 to 5.\n  CorrectAnswer: mean(1:5)\n  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('mean(1:5)', 'mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))')\n  Hint: You can use the form x:y or c(x, y) to provide numbers to mean().\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere's more on answer testing [in the Swirlify guidance](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/writing.html#answer-testing), including how to write custom answer tests.\n\n#### Lesson start-up {#startup}\n\nAnything in the `initLesson.R` file will be run when the lesson is loaded. You can create objects and refer to them in your questions. For example, you could add a data frame:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbiscuits <- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Chocolate hobnob\", \"Digestive\", \"Custard cream\"),\n  rating = c(10, 5, 7) \n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou could then ask in `lesson.yaml` something like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n- Class: cmd_question\n  Output: Use index notation to subset for biscuits rated over 5.\n  CorrectAnswer: biscuits[biscuits$rating > 5, ]\n  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='biscuits[, biscuits$rating > 5]')\n  Hint: Remember the indexing format dataframe[rows, columns].\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data frame was loaded on start-up, so the user can interact with it to answer the question.\n\nYou can also add data sets to the lesson folder and read them into the user's environment via the `initLesson.R` file. See the Swirlify [guidance on including data](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/structure.html#including-data) for more information.\n\n### Share your course {#share}\n\nCongratulations. You're ready to share your course.\n\nThere are [several ways to do this](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/sharing.html). It's easiest for learners to use Swirl's `swirl::install_course_*()` functions to install courses from:\n\n* a GitHub repo\n* a zip file stored on DropBox, Google Drive, or some URL\n* a course folder---zipped or not----downloaded locally on their machine\n\nYou can also compress your course to a single `.swc` file with `compress_course()` and raise a pull request for it to be hosted on the [Swirl Course Network](http://swirlstats.com/scn/). It can be downloaded from there with `install_course()`.\n\nSwirl is strengthened by having a greater number and range of courses.\n\n## Plea\n\nThe R community is large and friendly. Swirl helps people learn. It would be great to see more courses being made. Consider making one to teach your colleagues about common R tasks in your department, for example. \n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-08-01 19:49:01 BST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/London\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.23    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.7    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.33     rlang_1.1.1       fontawesome_0.5.1 evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>",
