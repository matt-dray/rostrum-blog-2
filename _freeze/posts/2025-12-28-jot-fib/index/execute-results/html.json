What?\n\nI added helpers `--where` and `--version` (`-w` and  `-v`) as quality-of-life improvements.\n\n`--where` is useful if you forget the file paths handled by jot, which are:\n\n* the config file, which contains a key-value path to the jot file\n* the jot file, which is where the text of the jottings is saved\n\n```sh\njot -w\n```\n```\n📍 Default path to config file: /Users/mattdray/.jot-config.json\n📍 Path to jot file: /Users/mattdray/Documents/jot.txt\n```\n\nThe tool has gone through a bunch of changes, so you can check what version you're running with `--version`.\n\n```sh\njot -v\n```\n```\n0.2.11\n```\n\nThe version number is also provided now when you run `jot --help` (`-h`) to print the help documentation.\n\nAssuming you're using uv, run `uv tool upgrade jot` to get the latest version.\n\n## When?\n\nI mentioned using a regular expression to filter for jottings between dates.\nThat's awful[^rx].\n\nHelpfully, [Olivier Iffrig-Petit](https://github.com/oiffrig) contributed a couple of new options to handle this.\n\n`--from` and `--to` (`-f` and `-t`) take values in the form `YYYYMMDD` to filter from (inclusive) and to (exclusive) given dates.\nThey can be used alone or together, along with `--search` and `--list`.\n\nSo, to return jottings from 26 August 2025 up to (but not including) 28 August 2025:\n\n```sh\njot -f 20250826 -t 20250828\n```\n```\n[2025-08-27 10:58] ate a kiwi\n[2025-08-26 11:09] ate a pineapple\n```\n\nIsolating time periods like this has helped me find information to write weeknotes and complete my timesheets.\n\nMany thanks Olivier.\n\n## Sure?\n\nAlong with these features, I've added basic tests for the Python functions using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).\nA couple of things that were new to me were:\n\n* the `@pytest.mark.parametrize()` decorator, which helps set up inputs that can be iterated over in a test\n* that `capsys` captures system outputs, as the name implies, which you can compare to expected values\n\nAnd naturally my patience was tested trying to get the pytest GitHub Action to run correctly.\n\n## Next?\n\nNext thing might be to [prepare jot for PyPi](https://github.com/matt-dray/jot/issues/44).\nThere's probably two breaking changes to be made before then: \n\n1. Save the config file [somewhere more suitable](https://github.com/matt-dray/jot/issues/14) than the user's home directory.\n2. [Rename the package](https://github.com/matt-dray/jot/issues/57) because there's [already a macOS tool named 'jot'](https://ss64.com/mac/jot.html), lol[^doc].\n\nSo, perhaps, finally, maybe, for now:\n\n> It’s basically feature-complete from my perspective.\n\n### Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[project]\nname = \"2025-12-28-jot-fib\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nrequires-python = \">=3.12\"\ndependencies = []\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^rx]: 'Regex? Now you have two problems.'\n[^doc]: Or alias and document it so the user can decide. Either way, 'jot' is already taken on PyPi, so the package name will need changing even if the entry point doesn't.",
