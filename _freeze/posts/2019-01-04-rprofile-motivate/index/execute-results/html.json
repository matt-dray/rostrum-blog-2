You can use it to customise your environment. For example, you could set options, create functions or load packages.\n\nThere's lots of information in [the R startup chapter of Colin Gillespie's's _Efficient R Programming_ book](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#r-startup).\n\nBut beware: use of an R profile may not be particularly reproducible if the .Rprofile file is unavailable to others who are executing your code. For example, you might use your profile to load packages that aren't installed by another user.\n\nYou can use your favourite search engine to find examples of people's R profiles. For example, in:\n\n* [Tony Fischetti's _On the Lambda_ blog](http://www.onthelambda.com/2014/09/17/fun-with-rprofile-and-customizing-r-startup/)\n* [Kris Eberwein's post on _how to pimp your Rprofile_](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-pimp-your-rprofile/)\n* [Stephen Turner's post on _Getting Genetics Done_ blog](http://www.gettinggeneticsdone.com/2013/07/customize-rprofile.html)\n* [Jesse Lecy's GitHub repo](https://github.com/lecy/Rprofile)\n\nI'm going to create something a little more... fun.\n\n## How to edit your .Rprofile\n\nYou could navigate to where the .Rprofile file is stored on your machine and edit it, but it's easier to use the `edit_r_profile()` function from the `usethis` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n```\n:::\n\n```\n• Modify '/Users/mattdray/.Rprofile'• Restart R for changes to take effect\n```\n\nThe output from running this line shows the filepath to the .Rprofile and reminds you to restart R to reload the R profile and its newly-saved changes.\n\n## A frivolous use case \n\nYou could use your R profile to display a little message at start-up.\n\nIt's four days into 2019 and you may be struggling with those new year resolutions. You're probably going to need a motivational quote.\n\nWe can load [the `emo` package](https://github.com/hadley/emo) within the R profile and add emojis to our messages. There's a handy function -- `emo::ji_glue()` -- that allows you to paste text with emojis.\n\nThe following code selects one element at random from a set of motivational messages and prints it to the console on start-up.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(emo)  # devtools::install_github(\"hadley/emo\")\n\ncat(\n  sample(\n    x = c(\n      ji_glue(\"Don't let your dreams be dreams! :rainbow:\"),\n      ji_glue(\"Nothing is impossible! :raised_hands:\"),\n      ji_glue(\"Be brave! :triumph:\"),\n      ji_glue(\"Do the thing! Yeah! :white_check_mark:\"),\n      ji_glue(\"Haters gon' hate! :tipping_hand_woman:\"),\n      ji_glue(\"Crush your enemies! :fist:\"),\n      ji_glue(\"Generic motivational quote! :clap:\")\n    ),\n    size = 1\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou need a blank line at the end of the file. One will be added for you on save when editing in RStudio.\n\n## Outcome\n\nHere's the code in the script window and the result of having restarted R a few times.\n\n![Random messages selected from the .Rprofile on restart](resources/rprofile.png){fig-alt=alt=\"An RStudio window showing the .Rprofile script and several messages being printed to the console with successive restarts of the RStudio.\" width=\"100%\"}\n\nJust don't get stuck in a loop of restarting R over and over again so you can see the messages. You might get overmotivated. Or you'll spend so long restarting that you'll have wasted loads of time and will need more motivational quotes to encourage yourself not to do it anymore.\n\n<div class=\"tip\"> \n`<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\" style=\"height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:-0.125em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;font-size:inherit;fill:currentColor;overflow:visible;position:relative;\"><path d=\"M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zm0-384c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24V264c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24s-24-10.7-24-24V152c0-13.3 10.7-24 24-24zM224 352a32 32 0 1 1 64 0 32 32 0 1 1 -64 0z\"/></svg>`{=html} <b>Note</b>\n\nI forgot that there's [a great package called {praise}](https://github.com/rladies/praise) via [RLadies](https://rladies.org/) that can generate the positive messages for you.
