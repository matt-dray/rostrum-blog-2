The console is running the code pixeltrix::click_pixels(6, 7, 3) and a plot appears with a 6 by 7 square grid. Some squares are clicked, changing them to light grey. A second click turns them dark grey. Eventually a little square character with a face is created. A matrix encoded the image is shown in the console when the escape key is pressed.\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## tl;dr\n\nI've written [{pixeltrix}](https://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix), an R package that lets you select 'pixels' interactively from a plot window and returns your final image as a matrix. You could use it to design sprites, for example.\n\n## Pixel perfect\n\nI've written before about [creating very simple pixel art in R](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/06/28/pixel-art/). To create a sprite of Link from _The Legend of Zelda_ I had to write out by hand a vector that encoded its pixel values. It was tedious.\n\nThere are, however, a couple of options in R to take an image and extract the pixels from it: see Florian Privé's Shiny app in [the {pixelart} package](https://github.com/privefl/pixelart) and Mike Cheng's (AKA coolbutuseless) [blog post](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2018/08/13/gganimate-with-sprites/) that also describes how to animate them.[^voxel]\n\nBut what if you want to create a sprite from scratch? It would be great if you could click pixels interactively and be returned a matrix encoding your image.\n\nI couldn't find an R package to do this, so I decided to make a very simple one: [{pixeltrix}](https://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix) (as in 'pixel' and 'matrix', but also as in 'tricks'[^michael], lol). \n\nIt's written entirely in base R (no Shiny or server needed) and can be run in the R console. It's basically a `repeat` loop that runs `image()` to plot squares[^overhang] (hereafter 'pixels') and `locator()`[^locator] to let you click those pixels on and off. The coordinates of each click are matched to the nearest pixel centre, the pixel's value is incremented by 1 (or wrapped back to zero) and the image is redrawn.\n\nThe package is still in development, but I think it's reached a useable state for my own purposes.\n\n<div class=\"tip\"> ℹ️ <b>Update</b>\n\nI lied. The package has been updated since this post. You can read about the changes in [a more recent blogpost](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/12/11/pixeltrix-animate/). Highlight: you can make animations now.\n\n</div>\n\n## Enter the matrix\n\nThe package is available for download [from GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix). I have some ideas on how to improve it; go ahead and add your own ideas to the [issues tracker](https://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix/issues).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(remotes)  # if not yet installed\nremotes::install_github(\"matt-dray/pixeltrix\") # v0.1 in this post\nlibrary(pixeltrix)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe main function is `click_pixels()`, to which you pass plot dimensions (how many pixels tall and wide), the number of pixel 'states' (the number of values a pixel can take, so binary would be `2`) and whether you want to put a grid over the plot (makes it easier to see where the pixels are).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclick_pixels(\n  n_rows   = 3,\n  n_cols   = 3,\n  n_states = 2,\n  grid = TRUE\n) -> x\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis opens a plot window. Repeatedly click a pixel to cycle it through the number of states you asked for. For example, `n_states = 4` means you cycle it through values of 0, 1, 2 and 3 (wrapping back to 0), which will be manifested in the plot as different shades of grey. \n\nNote that you can only click one pixel at a time, so you'll have to do a lot of clicking if your `n_states` value is high. Colouring stuff in really slowly is called 'mindfulness', I believe; good for your wellbeing.\n\nWhen you're done, you press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, or the 'Finish' button in the plot window of RStudio. I saved all the images below via the 'Export' button in RStudio.\n\n![](resources/simple.png){fig-alt=\"A 3 by 3 square panel grid with darker squares in an x-shaped pattern.\"}\n\nYou're returned a matrix that contains the value of each pixel in your image. So if you had set `n_states = 3`, a twice-clicked pixel gets the value 2, an unclicked pixel defaults to a value of 0, etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx\n```\n:::\n\n```\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    0    1\n[2,]    0    1    0\n[3,]    1    0    1\n```\n\nThis matrix is basically a blueprint of the image you created. You can take this and do other things with it. Maybe you'll make art by passing it to `ggplot()` to match each of the pixel-state values to a colour. Maybe you'll use it to plan your crochet or cross-stitch[^crochet], or to [teach spatial epidemiology](https://twitter.com/mohsinramay_/status/1573750033857581057?s=20&t=07-AlT6Dhn9b2GnuJN3SQg) (!).\n\nIf you want to edit your matrix, you can pass it into `edit_pixels()`. This means you don't have to start over from scratch with `click_pixels()` if you only want to change something small. Note that you can provide a higher `n_states` value to `edit_pixels()` than the current maximum in the matrix you provided.\n\n## Sprite club\n\nMy main purpose for the package is to create simple [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)).\n\nI used {pixeltrix} to make each of the sprites below. They took about a minute each. It would've taken much longer to write their matrices by hand and to keep passing them to `image()` to visuliase them and make sure there weren't any mistakes.\n\n### Tamagotchi\n\nHere's a 1-bit original kuchipatchi sprite from [the original 90s Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) digital pets. It uses the default of two pixel states (binary): so 0 for white and 1 for grey.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclick_pixels(14, 14) -> tam_sprite\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](resources/kuchipatchi.png){fig-alt=\"A 14 by 14 pixel grid with a two-toned sprite of a pet character from the original 90s Tamagotchi pets.\"}\n\n<details><summary>Click to expand matrix</summary>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntam_sprite\n```\n:::\n\n```\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14]\n [1,]    0    0    0    0    1    1    1    1    1     1     0     0     0     0\n [2,]    0    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    0     0     1     0     0     0\n [3,]    0    1    1    0    1    0    0    0    0     1     0     1     0     0\n [4,]    1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     1     0\n [5,]    0    1    1    1    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     1     0\n [6,]    1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     1     0\n [7,]    0    1    1    1    0    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     1     0\n [8,]    0    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    1     0     1     0     0     1\n [9,]    0    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    1     0     1     0     0     1\n[10,]    0    0    0    1    0    0    0    0    0     1     0     0     0     1\n[11,]    0    0    0    0    1    0    0    0    0     0     0     0     1     0\n[12,]    0    0    0    0    0    1    0    1    1     1     0     1     0     0\n[13,]    0    0    0    0    0    1    0    1    0     1     0     1     0     0\n[14,]    0    0    0    0    0    0    1    0    0     0     1     0     0     0\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Pokémon\n\nHere's the player character from [the first generation of Pokémon games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue) on the Game Boy.

You get a persistent interactive digital pet on your computer whose stats update in 'real time' while you're away.\n\nI want to print a largeish canvas of pixels to visualise multiple pet 'species' and for the various interactions you can have (playing, feeding, cleaning). {pixeltrix} makes it much easier to design these scenes and returns matrices that I can add directly to {tamRgo}.\n\n<div class=\"tip\"> ℹ️ <b>Update</b>\n\nI've now [written a post about {tamRgo}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/11/13/tamrgo/), where you can see how {pixeltrix} was used for the character sprites.\n\n</div>\n\n## Environment {.appendix}\n\n<details><summary>Session info</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLast rendered: 2023-06-29 18:52:13 CEST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16)\nPlatform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Ventura 13.2.1\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib \nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib;  LAPACK version 3.11.0\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\ntime zone: Europe/Zurich\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] pixeltrix_0.2.1.9000\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.2 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.1        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.5   rstudioapi_0.14   yaml_2.3.7       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.22    knitr_1.43.1      jsonlite_1.8.5    xfun_0.39        \n[13] digest_0.6.31     rlang_1.1.1       evaluate_0.21    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n[^voxel]: You can even go into the third dimension (i.e. voxels) with Mike's [{isocubes}](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/isocubes) and its extension [{oblicubes}](https://github.com/trevorld/oblicubes) by Trevor L Davies.
