## tl;dr

Two toy R functions for playing with [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) results: `twirdle()` extracts gameplay data from tweets, and `eldrow()` finds potential prior guesses given the answer.

<div class="tip"> ❗️ <b>Warning</b>

The Twitter API is pretty borked as of mid-2023, so the functions in this post are unlikely to work anymore.

## What's the Wordle?

Nothing is more zeitgeisty right now than [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), a once-a-day web-based five-letter-word-guessing puzzle-logic game.

The app lets you copy your results in a consistent format for pasting into a tweet or whatever. 

![](resources/wordle-result.png){fig-alt="An example results output from Wordle edition 209 that took three attempts. The first row of coloured square emojis is the first guess, showing a letter in the wrong place (yellow) and one in the right place (green). The second guess has two in the wrong place and one correct. The last line shows victory. The black emojis show incorrect guesses." width="50%"}

It begins with a string of meta information, 'Wordle X Y/Z', where X is the edition number, Y is the attempts taken and Z is the maximum allowed guesses. Then there's a grid of coloured emoji squares, where each row represents a guessed word and each emoji a letter.

Green emojis (orange in colorblind mode) represent a letter in the correct place, yellow (blue in colorblind mode) in the wrong place and white for an incorrect letter (or black if playing in dark mode). The emojis obscure your guesses so that people can see how well you did without spoiling the answer.

Folks have already put together some neat R tools, like solvers and ways to play in the console or in other languages. See [mikefc's {wordle} R package](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/wordle) and [Pachá's Shiny app](https://pacha.dev/blog/2022/01/14/shinywordle-a-shiny-app-to-solve-the-game-worldle-and-the-power-of-regular-expressions/), for example. 

## Wordle up

Surprise: I haven't actually played the game.[^manipulate]

But that didn't stop me from writing a couple of modest functions to practice my regex and base-R skills: `twirdle()` and `eldrow()`.[^fndd] 

As ever, I can call them 'toy' functions and get away without proper error-checking and code optimisation.

### twirdle

The consistent Wordle template makes it straightforward to extract people's results from tweets. I've made the `twirdle()` function to do this.[^twitter]

`twirdle()` makes use of regular expressions and functions like `regmatches()` and `regexpr()` to extract: 

* the Wordle `edition` number, e.g. '206'
* the `attempt`s required, e.g. '4', but also failures symbolised with 'X'
* the maximum `allowed` attempts (`max`), i.e. '6'
* whether the user was playing in light or dark `mode`
* whether the user was using `colorblind` mode
* a string of characters representing the emoji `grid`, e.g. `"YG----G-GYGGGGG"`, to symbolise a correct guess (i.e. a `G`reen emoji), a correct letter but in the wrong place (i.e. `Y`ellow), and a miss (`-`)
* the tweet `status_id` so you can visit the original tweets

             "colorblind", "grid", "status_id")]
  
}
```
</details>

I also put the code for the function [in a GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/matt-dray/996d066ead78acfaca47c0d37b966e8a).

#### Example

To give an example of `twirdle()` in action, let's first grab a small number of tweets using [the {rtweet} package by Mike Kearney](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/). I think it's best to supply the query string of `search_tweets()` with the word 'Wordle' and at least one white or black emoji (signifying an incorrect letter).[^query]

```{r rtweet}
tweets <- rtweet::search_tweets(
  q = "Wordle \U2B1B OR \U2B1C",
  n = 10,  # return 10 tweets
  include_rts = FALSE  # no retweets
)
```

And now we can pass the returned dataframe of tweets to `twirdle()`. It outputs a row per tweet, but there may be fewer tweets than we asked for because the content doesn't conform to the output provided by Wordle. Sometimes people add their own comments into the results, disrupting the expected format. There's also a Spanish version that has '(ES)' in the meta information that we're going to exclude for our purposes.

Note that anyone who didn't complete the puzzle in six tries gets a score of 'X/6', which is returned as `NA_real_` in the `attempts` column.

```{r twirdle-ex}
twirdle(tweets)
```
```

```

You could use this to do a number of things, like calculate the mean number of attempts for each day's puzzle, look for guess patterns at scale, or maybe [see whether dark-mode users are more skilled than light-mode users](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1481071855465287680?s=20).

### eldrow

Of course, the whole purpose of sharing an encoded emoji grid is to prevent spoilers. No-one reading your result can see the answer or your guesses.

But, if you do know the answer, could you backwards-engineer prior guesses from the emoji grid? 

Introducing `eldrow()`,[^backwards] which does exactly this with some help from [mikefc's {wordle} package](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/wordle) for filtering from the Wordle wordlist.[^cbu]

You pass to it the `answer` and the encoding of the last `guess` in the form `"Y-GY-"`. As per the `twirdle()` output, the characters `G`, `Y` and `-` refer to a letter in the right place, wrong place, or not in the word. The function returns a vector of all the possible words given the `guess` and the `answer`.

One thing it doesn't deal with is whether people are playing in 'hard mode', where 'any revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses'. I think you could infer if someone was playing this way, but you could never be completely sure.

#### Code

<details><summary>Click for the full `eldrow()` definition</summary>
```{r eldrow-fn}
eldrow <- function(guess, answer, words = wordle::wordle_dict){
  
  answer <- tolower(answer)
  guess <- toupper(guess)
  
  guess_chars <- strsplit(guess, "")[[1]]
  answer_chars <- strsplit(answer, "")[[1]]
  
  exact <- ifelse(guess_chars == "G", answer_chars, ".") |>
    paste0(collapse = "")
  
  wrong_spot <- gsub(
    "\\.", "", ifelse(guess_chars == "Y", answer_chars, ".")
  )
  
  exact_chars <- regmatches(exact, gregexpr("\\w", exact))[[1]]
  correct_chars_table <- table(
    c(exact_chars, wrong_spot[wrong_spot != ""])
  )
  min_count <- as.vector(correct_chars_table)
  names(min_count) <- names(correct_chars_table)
  
  possibles <- wordle::filter_words(
    words, exact, wrong_spot, min_count, min_count
  )
  
  possibles <- possibles[which(possibles != answer)]
  possibles[order(possibles)]
  
}
```
</details>

I also put the code for this [in a GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/matt-dray/fe1f236f21abe7d2e4b2a594d5b207e1).

#### Example

So, let's say someone took three attempts at the word 'shirt'[^shirt] and their first and second guesses gave encodings of `"YGG--"` then `"-GGG-"`.

We can start by passing the answer and the encoding for the prior guess.

```{r eldrow-penultimate}
guess_2 <- eldrow(guess = "-GGG-", answer = "shirt")
guess_2
```
```
 [1] "chirk" "chirl" "chirm" "chiro" "chirp" "chirt" "chiru" "shire" "shirk"
[10] "shirs" "third" "thirl" "whirl" "whirs"
```

Okay, so logicically they could have guessed any of these 14 options before their final, correct guess.

Naturally, we can extrapolate one step further back and infer the earlier potential guesses.

You can iterate over these 14 possible words as the `answer` argument to `eldrow()`, setting the `guess` argument to the encoding for the previous attempt (i.e. `"YGG--"` was the first guess in our example).

```{r eldrow-guess-list}
guesses_1_2 <- lapply(
  guess_2,
  \(x) eldrow("YGG--", x)
) |> 
  lapply(\(x) x[which(x != "shirt")]) |>
  setNames(guess_2)

str(guesses_1_2)
```
```
List of 14
 $ chirk: chr "thick"
 $ chirl: chr "thick"
 $ chirm: chr "thick"
 $ chiro: chr "thick"
 $ chirp: chr "thick"
 $ chirt: chr "thick"
 $ chiru: chr "thick"
 $ shire: chr [1:22] "chias" "chibs" "chics" "chiks" ...
 $ shirk: chr [1:22] "chias" "chibs" "chics" "chiks" ...
 $ shirs: chr [1:22] "chias" "chibs" "chics" "chiks" ...
 $ third: chr [1:13] "ahint" "chirt" "chits" "shift" ...
 $ thirl: chr [1:13] "ahint" "chirt" "chits" "shift" ...
 $ whirl: chr(0) 
 $ whirs: chr(0)
```

The output is a list with elements containing the potential first guesses and is named for each of the potential second guesses. So, logically, a possible set of guesses by this imaginary person was 'shift' then 'third' then 'shirts'.

Of course, you can eliminate any potential second guesses that failed to yield a potential first guess, like 'whirl' in this example.

You'll also notice a number of the potential first guesses are the same word. The more they appear, the more likely that word is to have been the actual starting guess, I suppose?

```{r eldrow-likeliest}
words <- c()
for (i in guesses_1_2) {
  words <- c(words, i)
}

counts <- as.data.frame(
  table(words),
  responseName = "n"
)
counts$total <- sum(counts$n)
counts$percent <- round(100 * (counts$n / counts$total), 1)

likeliest <- counts[order(-counts$percent), ]
rownames(likeliest) <- NULL
head(likeliest, 3)
```
```
  words n total percent
1 thick 7    99     7.1
2 chits 5    99     5.1
3 whist 5    99     5.1
```

So, purely on the basis of this frequency, 'thick' was most likely to be the first guess in this contrived example. You might want to consider how likely someone is to actually submit some of these words, given their obscurity.[^thick]

## Hurdle?

I hope you weren't expecting anything more from this post. Maybe consider some meme variants, like [Curdle](https://twitter.com/Hooper_b13/status/1480838944812158977?s=20), [Birdle](https://twitter.com/BebeNeuwirth/status/1479966069469204483?s=20), [Tetris](https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1480643494985146372?s=20), or [this absolute banger](https://twitter.com/AaronChewning/status/1481701906808516610?s=20).

Okay, show's over, you can stop the Wordling now.

[^shirt]: No spoilers here. I have no idea if this word has ever been a correct answer in Wordle to date.
[^fndd]: Us pros call this 'function-name driven development', or FNDD. It's very simple, you just choose a funny function name and work backwards from there.
[^backwards]: DO YOU SEE IT IS LIKE 'WORDLE' BACKWARDS? HA HA HA.
[^twitter]: DO YOU SEE IT IS LIKE 'TWITTER' AND 'WORDLE' FUSED TOGETHER, LOL.
[^manipulate]: I am simply manipulating you for clicks.
[^thick]: 'Thick Chitswhist' is a Star Wars Expanded Universe character, I think?
[^cbu]: This is a little manoeuvre I like to call 'mikefc-Driven Development' (MDD). See [a very recent post on this blog ](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/12/30/gpx3d/) for an example.
[^query]: I initially put five green emoji in the query string, since all successful Wordles end this way. But then you miss out those people who didn't get a correct answer by the sixth guess.
