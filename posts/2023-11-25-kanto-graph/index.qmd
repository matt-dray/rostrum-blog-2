![](resources/graph-zoom.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of an interactive graph. The title is 'Kanto' and the subtitle is 'a graph of locations in Pokémon Red'. A dropdown menu has 'Pallet Town' selected and in red text. A node labelled 'Pallet Town' is shown, highlighted in red, as are other labelled nodes like 'Oak's lab' and 'Blue's house' that it's directly connected to. A greyed-out node is also visible, which is not connected by an edge to the 'Pallet Town' node."}

## tl;dr

I extracted data from the disassembled code of Pokémon Red to create an interactive graph of the game's locations and their connections. You can [jump to the graph](#visualise-graph) below.

## Kanto

[I wrote a while back](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2021-11-04-kanto-locator/) about using the wonderful `locator()` function to extract coordinates from fictitious maps. In that example I used the Kanto region from [the original Pokémon games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red,_Blue,_and_Yellow). 

Today I'm back with the same map[^ideas], but we're going to be far more methodical and abstract: we're going to extract data from the underlying game files to build a graph that describes all the locations and connections between them.

This is made possible by [the 'pret' collaborative](https://github.com/pret), who have reverse-engineered, or 'disassembled', a number of Pokémon games. This is interesting for digi-archaeological reasons[^mew], but also for our frivolous purposes.

## Assemble

To get a copy of the game's[^blue] disassembled code, go to [the pret/pokered GitHub repo](https://github.com/pret/pokered), click the 'Code' button, then 'Download as zip' and finally unzip the file on your computer. 

We're interested in two subfolders: `/data/maps/objects/` and `/data/maps/headers/`. These both contain one file of [Assembly code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) per named location in the game, like `AgathasRoom.asm` and `Bikeshop.asm`. We'll be handling these as simple text files.

The 'objects' files contain information required to set up things like sprites and text for each location in the game. The example below is for the starting area: Pallet Town. For our purposes, we care about the `warp_events`, which indicate that you can step on a tile and be warped somewhere else. For example, standing on the door tile at tile location `5, 5` would warp you to `REDS_HOUSE_1F`, i.e. the first floor of the player's house.

```
object_const_def
const_export PALLETTOWN_OAK
const_export PALLETTOWN_GIRL
const_export PALLETTOWN_FISHER

PalletTown_Object:
db $b ; border block

def_warp_events
warp_event  5,  5, REDS_HOUSE_1F, 1
warp_event 13,  5, BLUES_HOUSE, 1
warp_event 12, 11, OAKS_LAB, 2

def_bg_events
bg_event 13, 13, TEXT_PALLETTOWN_OAKSLAB_SIGN
bg_event  7,  9, TEXT_PALLETTOWN_SIGN
bg_event  3,  5, TEXT_PALLETTOWN_PLAYERSHOUSE_SIGN
bg_event 11,  5, TEXT_PALLETTOWN_RIVALSHOUSE_SIGN

def_object_events
object_event  8,  5, SPRITE_OAK, STAY, NONE, TEXT_PALLETTOWN_OAK
object_event  3,  8, SPRITE_GIRL, WALK, ANY_DIR, TEXT_PALLETTOWN_GIRL
object_event 11, 14, SPRITE_FISHER, WALK, ANY_DIR, TEXT_PALLETTOWN_FISHER

def_warps_to PALLET_TOWN
```

Some terminology for graphs: the game's locations are 'nodes' connected by common 'edges'. So Pallet Town and Red's House are nodes that share an edge.

Note that warping isn't the only thing that creates an edge between two nodes. If we look in the 'headers' file for Pallet Town, you can see that some locations have a simple `connection` parameter: you can just walk north of Pallet Town to Route 1 (the road to Viridian City) or approach from the south along Route 21 (from Cinnabar Island). Yes, 'routes' connect two places, but routes themselves act as nodes in this demo.

```
map_header PalletTown, PALLET_TOWN, OVERWORLD, NORTH | SOUTH
connection north, Route1, ROUTE_1, 0
connection south, Route21, ROUTE_21, 0
end_map_header
```

The headers file is useful to us in another way: it maps location names from the 'PalletTown' format (used in .asm filenames) to the 'PALLET_TOWN' format (as referenced within files). This knowledge will help us to better handle the data as we progress.

## Graph

So let's crack open the data and use some base R for corralling. Note that absolutely nothing here is optimised (or even written well in the first place), but regular readers will be used to that.

### Prepare functions

First we'll prepare some helper functions. To begin, a function that returns the filepaths for all the files we want to read. I saved my copy of the repo to `~/Documents/data/`, so I've set this path as the default.

```{r}
#| label: get-file-paths
.get_file_paths <- function(
    dir = "~/Documents/data/pokered-master/data/maps",
    type = c("objects", "headers")
) {
  path <- file.path(dir, type)
  list.files(path, pattern = ".asm$", full.names = TRUE)
}
```

Then a function to extract the warps in the text of each objects file:

```{r}
#| label: get-warps
.get_warps <- function(objects_content) {
  warp_string <- "warp_event "
  warp_events <- objects_content[grepl(warp_string, objects_content)]
  unique(unlist(lapply(strsplit(warp_events, ", "), `[[`, 3)))
}
```

For the headers files, we'll need a function to extract all the connections:

```{r}
#| label: get-connections
.get_connections <- function(headers_content) {
  con_string <- "connection"
  con_detected <- headers_content[grepl(con_string, headers_content)]
  con_isolated <- lapply(con_detected, \(x) x[which(grepl(con_string, x))])
  lapply(con_isolated, \(x) unlist(lapply(strsplit(x, ", "), `[[`, 3)))
}
```

And also we want a function to extract the UpperCamelCase and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE variants of each location:

```{r}
#| label: create-names-lookup
.create_names_lookup <- function(headers_content) {
  headers_split <- strsplit(headers_content, ",")[[1]]
  headers_split <- headers_split[1:2]
  name_pair <- gsub("map_header ", "", trimws(headers_split))
  setNames(name_pair[1], name_pair[2])
}
```

### Extract connections data

Now down to business. We'll read the text content of each headers file into a list, then name these elements using the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE name for each location.

```{r}
#| label: headers-file
headers_files <- .get_file_paths(type = "headers")
headers_content <- lapply(headers_files, readLines)
headers_lookup <- unlist(lapply(headers_content, .create_names_lookup))
names(headers_content) <- names(headers_lookup)
```

Here's how Pallet Town looks in this format:

```{r}
#| label: headers-conent-pallet-town
headers_content["PALLET_TOWN"]
```

Now we can take these lines of text and extract the node pairs that have an edge due to a 'connection' between them.

```{r}
#| label: conns-df
conns <- .get_connections(headers_content)
conns_df <- stack(conns)
conns_df <- conns_df[, c("ind", "values")]
names(conns_df) <- c("from", "to")
conns_df[["from"]] <- as.character(conns_df[["from"]])
head(conns_df)
```

### Extract warp data

Similarly, we can get the warp data in a node-pair data frame as well. The first step is to read the text of each objects file into a list.

```{r}
#| label: obj-content
obj_files <- .get_file_paths(type = "objects")
obj_names <- gsub(".asm", "", basename(obj_files))
obj_content <- lapply(obj_files, readLines) |>
  setNames(names(headers_lookup))
obj_content["PALLET_TOWN"]
```

Then we can extract the warps. Note that some warps don't explicitly take you back where you came from. Instead the instruction is to warp to the last location. We can remove this from our data, since `LAST_MAP` isn't a literal location.

```{r}
#| label: warps
warps <- lapply(obj_content, .get_warps)
warps <- lapply(warps, \(x) x[x != "LAST_MAP"])
warps <- warps[lengths(warps) > 0]
warps_df <- stack(warps)
warps_df <- warps_df[, c("ind", "values")]
names(warps_df) <- c("from", "to")
warps_df[["from"]] <- as.character(warps_df[["from"]])
head(warps_df)
```

### Combine all node pairs

Now we can combine all the node pairs that share edges, whether its by a simple connection or a warp. In this example we're interested in combinations, rather than permutations, of node pairs. This means that we can treat A→B and B→A as equivalent and simplify down to just A→B.

```{r}
#| label: edges
edges <- rbind(warps_df, conns_df)
edges <- edges[!duplicated(data.frame(t(apply(edges, 1, sort)))), ]  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/50117582
tail(edges)
```

We also want a full list of the nodes, which will help us to label and filter them in the final visualisation.

```{r}
#| label: nodes-and-edges
nodes <- data.frame(id = unique(c(edges[["from"]], edges[["to"]])))
nodes <- nodes[order(nodes[["id"]]), , drop = FALSE]
```

### Visualise {#visualise-graph}

[The {visNetwork} package](https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/) wraps [the vis.js JavaScript library](https://visjs.org/), which will help output an interactive HTML graph. We just need to feed it our nodes and edges and a bunch of configuration and styling options. For example, I've used the font from the games and a red colour accent to reflect the game variant[^passion].

```{r}
#| label: visnetwork
library(visNetwork)

visNetwork(
  nodes,
  edges,
  width = "100%",
  height = "600px",
  main = list(
    text = "Kanto",
    style = "font-family:'pokemon-font';font-size:30px;color:black;"
  ),
  submain = list(
    text = "A graph of locations in PKMN Red<br><br>",
    style = "font-family:'pokemon-font';font-size:15px;color:black;"
  ),
  footer = list(
    text = "Source: Nintendo and Game Freak via the pret/pokered dissassembly project",
    style = "font-family:'pokemon-font';font-size:8px;color:black;text-align:right;"
  )
) |>
  visEdges(
    color = list(color = "#FF7777", highlight = "#FF0000", opacity = 0.5),
    width = 3,
    selectionWidth = 5
  ) |>
  visNodes(
    color = "#FF7777",
    font = list(face = "pokemon-font", size = 10),
    borderWidth = 0,
    borderWidthSelected = 3,
  ) |>
  visOptions(
    highlightNearest = TRUE,
    nodesIdSelection = list(
      enabled = TRUE,
      main = "Select a location",
      style = "font-family:'pokemon-font';font-size:15px;color:red;"
    )
  ) |>
  visLayout(randomSeed = 150) |>
  visPhysics(
    solver = "barnesHut",
    barnesHut = list(springConstant = 0.1, gravitationalConstant = -10000)
  )
```

It can take a moment to load. You can select a node from the dropdown menu, scroll to zoom, and click on the nodes and edges themselves. The node labels will appear when you zoom in.

It was interesting to see the simple radial networks around each city; the complicated relationships between the nodes of Silph Co; the long 'tail' from Victory Road through the Elite Four to the Hall of Fame; and the hand-like structure of the Safari Zone.

Of course, you could spend all day tweaking things like the physics of the relationship between each node, or you could replace each node an images of its in-game sprite. I've chosen to keep things relatively simple because it's bed time and I need to go and [count some Wooloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooloo).

[^ideas]: Oh no! He's running out of ideas!
[^blue]: As a diehard Blue-version enjoyer, it pains me slightly that this is the Red version. Red is the bad guy! Blue is the good guy!
[^passion]: Graphic design is my passion, etc. As a colourblind person, I'm just glad they didn't release Red and Green versions simultaneously.
[^mew]: Not to mention that you can mess about with modding the game, like adjusting the code to [set Mew as one of the starter 'mons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5R8mcmlbFQ).
