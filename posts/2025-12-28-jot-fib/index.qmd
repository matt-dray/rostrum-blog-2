![](resources/jot-fib.png){fig-align="left" fig-alt="Screenshot of a macOS terminal window running the jot tool four times, with option 'v' to print the version number; 'w' to print where the config and jot files are; 's' and 'l' to search for the most recent jotting that contains the word 'apple'; and 'f' and 't' flags to return jottings from one date to another."}

## tl;dr

[jot](https://github.com/matt-dray/jot) now has `--where`, `--version`, `--from` and `--to` options.

## Whoops

Me, lying, the [last time I posted about jot](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2025-08-30-jot-options/):

> It’s basically feature-complete from my perspective.

Reminder: [jot](https://github.com/matt-dray/jot) is my simple little Python CLI for recording timestamped notes to a text file.

In fact, now you can:

* combine options
* search between specific dates
* quickly get tool meta-information

## And?

Options `--search` and `--list` (`-s` and `-l`) can now be used in combination.

This was achieved by adding an argument to the `search_jottings()` function that takes the value given by `--list`.

So, assuming this little jot file:

```{.txt filename="jot.txt"}
[2025-08-28 11:15] ate an apple
[2025-08-27 10:58] ate a kiwi
[2025-08-26 11:09] ate a pineapple
[2025-08-25 10:40] ate an apple and a pear
```

A casual `--search` will return anything matching your search term.

```sh
jot -s "apple"
```
```
[2025-08-28 11:15] ate an apple
[2025-08-26 11:09] ate a pineapple
[2025-08-25 10:40] ate an apple and a pear
```

But that could overwhelm the console if you have a lot of jottings.

So now you can add the `--list` flag to limit to the most recent _n_ jottings that match the search term.

```sh
jot -s "apple" -l 1
```
```
[2025-08-28 11:15] ate an apple
```

## Where? What?

I added helpers `--where` and `--version` (`-w` and  `-v`) as quality-of-life improvements.

`--where` is useful if you forget the file paths handled by jot, which are:

* the config file, which contains a key-value path to the jot file
* the jot file, which is where the text of the jottings is saved

```sh
jot -w
```
```
📍 Default path to config file: /Users/mattdray/.jot-config.json
📍 Path to jot file: /Users/mattdray/Documents/jot.txt
```

The tool has gone through a bunch of changes, so you can check what version you're running with `--version`.

```sh
jot -v
```
```
0.2.11
```

The version number is also provided now when you run `jot --help` (`-h`) to print the help documentation.

Assuming you're using uv, run `uv tool upgrade jot` to get the latest version.

## When?

I mentioned using a regular expression to filter for jottings between dates.
That's awful[^rx].

Helpfully, [Olivier Iffrig-Petit](https://github.com/oiffrig) contributed a couple of new options to handle this.

`--from` and `--to` (`-f` and `-t`) take values in the form `YYYYMMDD` to filter from (inclusive) and to (exclusive) given dates.
They can be used alone or together, along with `--search` and `--list`.

So, to return jottings from 26 August 2025 up to (but not including) 28 August 2025:

```sh
jot -f 20250826 -t 20250828
```
```
[2025-08-27 10:58] ate a kiwi
[2025-08-26 11:09] ate a pineapple
```

Isolating time periods like this has helped me find information to write weeknotes and complete my timesheets.

Many thanks Olivier.

## Sure?

Along with these features, I've added basic tests for the Python functions using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
A couple of things that were new to me were:

* the `@pytest.mark.parametrize()` decorator, which helps set up inputs that can be iterated over in a test
* that `capsys` captures system outputs, as the name implies, which you can compare to expected values

And naturally my patience was tested trying to get the pytest GitHub Action to run correctly.

## Next?

Next thing might be to [prepare jot for PyPi](https://github.com/matt-dray/jot/issues/44).
There's probably two breaking changes to be made before then: 

1. Save the config file [somewhere more suitable](https://github.com/matt-dray/jot/issues/14) than the user's home directory.
2. [Rename the package](https://github.com/matt-dray/jot/issues/57) because there's [already a macOS tool named 'jot'](https://ss64.com/mac/jot.html), lol[^doc].

So, perhaps, finally, maybe, for now:

```{r sessioninfo, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines("pyproject.toml"), sep = "\n")
```

[^rx]: 'Regex? Now you have two problems.'
[^doc]: Or alias and document it so the user can decide. Either way, 'jot' is already taken on PyPi, so the package name will need changing even if the entry point doesn't.
