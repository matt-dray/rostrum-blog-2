## tl;dr

I recently [made a Twitter bot with R, {rtweet}, MapBox and GitHub Actions](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/09/21/londonmapbot/) -- [londonmapbot](https://twitter.com/londonmapbot) -- that tweets images of random coordinates in London. I decided to explore them interactively by creating a simple [{leaflet}](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) map. You can [jump directly to the map](#map)).

Twitter changed its API terms in 2023. As a result, you probably can't re-run the code in this blog. [Read about](https://www.rostrum.blog/2023/02/09/londonmapbotstodon/) how I moved londonmapbot to Mastodon at [botsin.space/@londonmapbot](https://botsin.space/@londonmapbot) because of these changes.

## The bot

I built [the londonmapbot Twitter bot](https://www.twitter.com/londonmapbot/) as a fun little project to get to grips with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). An action is scheduled every 30 minutes to run some R code that (1) selects random coordinates in London, (2) fetches a satellite image from [the MapBox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/), (3) generates an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) URL, all of which are (4) passed to [{rtweet}](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/) to post to the londonmapbot account.

The outputs have been compelling so far. The composition is usually 'accidentally' pleasing. Sometimes landmarks are captured, like [The Shard](https://twitter.com/londonmapbot/status/1334220239467376643?s=20), [The Natural History Museum and V&A](https://twitter.com/londonmapbot/status/1333173374332395522?s=20) and [Heathrow](https://twitter.com/londonmapbot/status/1333702486545354752?s=20). 

![The Shard looks pointy even in 2D.](resources/shard.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of a tweet by londonmapbot showing a satellite view of the area round London Bridge Station and The Shard." width="100%"}

I was wondering whether the bot has 'found' other landmarks that I hadn't noticed or whether it's found my house. [The londonmapbot source code](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot) doesn't have a log file for all the coordinates it's generated, so I figured the easiest way to get this information and explore it would be to grab all the tweets -- which contain the coordinates as text -- and then map the results.

## Packages

I'm loading [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for data manipulation with {dplyr}, {tidyr} and {stringr}. [{rtweet}](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/) greatly simplifies the Twitter API and the objects it returns. We'll use it to fetch all the tweets from londonmapbot.

I'm using a few geography-related packages: 

* [{sf}](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for tidy dataframes with spatial information
* [{geojsonio}](https://docs.ropensci.org/geojsonio/) to read spatial files in geojson format
* [{PostcodesioR}](https://docs.ropensci.org/PostcodesioR/) to fetch additional geographic data given our x-y information
* [{leaflet}](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to build interactive maps from spatial data.

```{r packages, eval=TRUE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(rtweet)
  library(sf)
  library(geojsonio)
  library(PostcodesioR)
  library(leaflet)
})
```

A particular shoutout to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) for this post: {rtweet}, {geojsonio} and {PostcodesioR} have all passed muster to become part of the rOpenSci suite of approved packages.

## Fetch tweets

{rtweet} does all the legwork to fetch and parse information from the Twitter API, saving you loads of effort.

The `rtweet::get_timeline()` function is amazing in its user-side simplicity. Pass the account name from which to fetch tweets, along with the number of tweets to get (3200 is the maximum). 

```{r get-tweets}
lmb_tweets <- get_timeline("londonmapbot", n = 3200)
lmb_tweets[1:5, c("created_at", "text")]  # limited preview
```
```
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  created_at          text                                                      
  <dttm>              <chr>

5 2020-12-29 05:31:03 "51.4451, 0.1058\nhttps://t.co/nWuqy4s7am https://t.co/qv…
```

{rtweet} has a function to quick-plot tweets over time. There's meant to be a tweet every half-hour from londonmapbot, but GitHub Actions has been a little inconsistent and sometimes fails to post.

```{r ts-plot}
rtweet::ts_plot(lmb_tweets) +  # plot daily tweets
  labs(
    title = "@londonmapbot tweets per day",
    x = "", y = "", caption = "Data collected via {rtweet}"
  )
```
![](resources/ts-plot-1.png){fig-alt="Tweet volume from the londonmapbot account between September and December 2020. The amount is inconsistent and is about 25 to 40 tweets per day." width="100%"}

## Extract tweet information

The dataframe returned by {rtweet} contains nearly 100 columns. For our purposes we can minimise to:

* the unique tweet identifier, `status_id`, which we can use to build a URL back to the tweet
* the datetime the tweet was `created_at`
* the tweet text content, from which we can isolate the latitude and longitude values
* the `media_url` to the MapBox image attached to each tweet
* the full OpenStreetMap link in each tweet via `urls_expanded_urls` 

```{r simplify-tweets}
lmb_simple <- lmb_tweets %>% 
  filter(str_detect(text, "^\\d")) %>%  # must start with a digit
  separate(  # break column into new columns given separator
    text,  # column to separate
    into = c("lat", "lon"),  # names to split into
    sep = "\\s",  # separate on spaces
    extra = "drop" # discard split elements
  ) %>% 
  mutate(  # tidy up variables 
    lat = str_remove(lat, ","),
    across(c(lat, lon), as.numeric)
  ) %>% 
  select(  # focus variables
    status_id, created_at, lat, lon,
    osm_url = urls_expanded_url, media_url
  )

lmb_simple[1:5, c("status_id", "lat", "lon")]  # limited preview
```
```
# A tibble: 5 x 3
  status_id             lat    lon
  <chr>               <dbl>  <dbl>
1 1343853346478841862  51.6 -0.33 
2 1343844145518026752  51.4  0.164
3 1343806154397409280  51.7 -0.256
4 1343797964645523456  51.7 -0.404
5 1343791619049480192  51.4  0.106
```

## Reverse geocode

Tweets from londonmapbot are really simple by design; they only have the latitude and longitude, a link to OpenStreetMap and a satellite image pulled from [the MapBox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/). It might be interesting to provide additional geographic information.

{PostcodesioR} can perform a 'reverse geocode'[^wrassle] of our coordinates. Give latitude and longitude to `PostcodesioR::reverse_geocoding()` and it returns a list with various administrative geographies for that point.

```{r reverse-geocode, eval=TRUE}
lmb_geocode <-lmb_simple %>% 
  mutate(
    reverse_geocode = map2(
      .x = lon, .y = lat,
      ~reverse_geocoding(.x, .y, limit = 1)  # limit to first result
    )
  ) %>% 
  unnest(cols = reverse_geocode) %>%  # unpack listcol
  hoist(reverse_geocode, "postcode") %>%  # pull out postcode into a 
  hoist(reverse_geocode, "admin_district") # pull out borough

lmb_geocode[1:5, c("lat", "lon", "postcode", "admin_district")]  # limited preview
```

The object returned from the reverse geocode is a nested list that we can `tidyr::hoist()` the geographic information from. Here we grabbed the postcode and 'administrative district', which for our purposes is the London borough that the point is in.

## Convert to spatial object

Right now we have a dataframe where the geographic information is stored as numeric values. We can use the {sf} package to convert and handle this information as spatial information instead. 

Basically we can use {sf} to 'geographise' our dataframe. It can add geometry (points in our case), dimensions (XY, meaning 2D), the maximum geographic extent (a 'bounding box' that roughly covers London) and recognition of the coordinate reference system ('4236' for latitude-longitude).

The `sf::st_as_sf()` function performs the magic of converting our tidy dataframe into a tidy spatial dataframe. You'll see that the print method provides us the extra spatial metadata and that our geographic information has been stored in a special `geometry` column with class `sfc_POINT`.

```{r make-spatial, eval=TRUE}
lmb_sf <- lmb_geocode %>% 
  st_as_sf(
    coords = c("lon", "lat"),  # xy columns
    crs = 4326,  # coordinate reference system code
    remove = FALSE  # retain the xy columns
  )

lmb_sf[1:5, c("status_id", "geometry")]  # limited preview
```

## Map it

You can build up layers in {leaflet} in a similar kind of way to a {ggplot2} graphic. The base map is applied with `addProviderTiles()` and points added as circle-shaped markers with `addCircleMarkers()`. I used `addRectangles()` to show the bounding box from within which points are randomly sampled.

```{r build-map, eval=TRUE}
lmb_map <- leaflet(lmb_sf, width = '100%') %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addRectangles(
    lng1 = -0.489, lat1 = 51.28,
    lng2 =  0.236, lat2 = 51.686,
    fillColor = "transparent"
  ) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(  # locations as points
    lng = lmb_sf$lon, lat = lmb_sf$lat,  # xy
    radius = 5, stroke = FALSE,  # marker design
    fillOpacity = 0.5, fillColor = "#0000FF",  # marker colours
    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),  # bunch-up markers
    popup = ~paste0(  # dynamic HTML-creation for popup content
      emo::ji("round_pushpin"), " ", lmb_sf$lat, ", ", lmb_sf$lon, "<br>",
      emo::ji("postbox"), lmb_sf$admin_district, 
      ", ", lmb_sf$postcode, "<br>",
      emo::ji("bird"), " <a href='https://twitter.com/londonmapbot/status/",
      lmb_sf$status_id, "'>Tweet</a><br>",
      emo::ji("world_map"), " ", "<a href='",
      lmb_sf$osm_url, "' width='100%'>OpenStreetMap</a><br><br>",
      "<img src='", lmb_sf$media_url, "' width='200'>"
    )
  )
```

The markers, which are blue dots, have rich pop-ups when clicked. The information is generated dynamically for each point by pasting HTML strings with the content of the dataframe. Props to [Matt Kerlogue](https://lapsedgeographer.london/)'s [narrowbotR](https://twitter.com/narrowbotR), which uses this emoji-info layout in its automated tweets.

To keep the design simple and uncluttered, I've intentionally used a muted base map ('Positron' from CartoDB) and limited the amount of pop-up content.

In the pop-up you'll see information from the tweet, including the satellite image and printed coordinates; URLs to the original tweet and OpenStreetMap; plus the reverse-geocoded info we got from {PostcodesioR}. 

Since there are thousands of points, it makes sense to cluster them with `markerClusterOptions()` to avoid graphical and navigational troubles. Click a cluster to expand until you reach a marker.

## The map {#map}

```{r print-map, eval=TRUE}
lmb_map
```

If you can't see the satellite photos in each pop-up you may need to change browser.

## Development

I made this for my own amusement and as an excuse to use {PostcodesioR} and reacquaint myself with {leaflet}. If I were going to develop it, I would make a Shiny app that continuously refreshes with the latest tweet information. I may revisit londonmapbot in future, or create a new bot; in which case the reverse geocoding capabilities of {PostcodesioR} could come in handy for providing more content in tweet text.

[^wrassle]: I'm going to assume this is also a wrestling move.
