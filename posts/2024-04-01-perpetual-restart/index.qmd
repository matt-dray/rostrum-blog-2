## tl;dr

Make RStudio restart itself. Perpetually.

## Passing the torch

[Jenny Bryan once said](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/):

> If the first line of your R script is `rm(list = ls())` I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE üî•.

The objects in your R environment are wicked little imps whose only motivation is to deceive you. They must be destroyed. Frequently. 

But `rm(list = ls())` isn't enough to start a new session with a completely clean slate. It doesn't detach packages, for example. Reproducibility is at stake here, folks!

The only salvation is to completely restart R. All the time.

I don't think you heard me. Come closer. I said _all the time_.

## An extinguisher

I've been [woke to this thought technology](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2020-04-17-r-self-shame/index.html#env) for a while. You're right, it's time I gave back to the community.

I can't trust you to restart R voluntarily, so I must help you to help yourself.

So, I have for you a gift. A precious snippet of R code that came to me in a fever dream.

```{r}
setHook(
  "rstudio.sessionInit",
  function(...) {
    message("‚è≥ Restarting in 30 seconds...")
    Sys.sleep(30)
    rstudioapi::executeCommand("restartR")
  }
)
```

Simply open your `.Rprofile`[^dont1] ([a special file](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/360047157094-Managing-R-with-Rprofile-Renviron-Rprofile-site-Renviron-site-rsession-conf-and-repos-conf) that's executed at start up) with `usethis::edit_r_profile()`[^dont2], paste in the code[^dont3] and then restart R for it to take effect[^dont4].

What does it do? It waits for RStudio to start up[^rstudio] and then restarts R[^restart] after 30 seconds[^thespicemelange].

...Which prompts another restart after 30 more seconds.

...And another.

...Forever[^quit].

![trapped in a loop help I'm](resources/restart.png){fig.alt="The R console in RStudio. Repeated several times is the message 'restarting in 30 seconds...' then 'restarting R session'." width='100%'}

I know what you're thinking: doesn't this block the console? Kind of. You can still type stuff and it'll be executed before the next restart. Only to disappear immediately. 

Complete panic. Just like Jenny wanted! I think?

## Rise from the ashes

How can you thank me for this? I am humble (extremely), but you're welcome to [support my Patreon](https://github.com/scrogster/rickrollR/).

Happy March 32nd, colleagues.

cat("Last rendered:", format(Sys.time(), usetz = TRUE)); sessionInfo()

[^dont1]: Don't.
[^dont2]: Don't.
[^dont3]: Don't.
[^dont4]: Fine, [dew it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCscYsICvoA).
[^quit]: Maybe you'll have to force quit RStudio? Use <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> on a Macintosh or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> on Michaelsoft Binbows. I assume Linux users know what they're doing.
[^thespicemelange]: If you're feeling extra spicy, maybe randomise the wait period!
[^restart]: I also tried `rsudioapi::restartSession()` and `.rs.restartR()` here, but they didn't work quite as I expected. Let me know any non-RStudio ways to do this, of course.
[^rstudio]: The code depends on the {rstudioapi} package, but it needs to load before it can be used. This seems to happen _after_ the .Rprofile has been read. This is why we have to use `setHook()` with `rstudio.sessionInit` so the restart command can be executed once RStudio has initiated.
