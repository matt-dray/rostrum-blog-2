## tl;dr

In which a Markov chain perfectly summarises [my entire PhD thesis](https://orca.cf.ac.uk/68365/):

>In general, litter chemical composition and decomposition.

## {markovifyR}

[I posted a while back](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/06/30/markov-chain-phd/) about using [a Markov chain](https://hackernoon.com/from-what-is-a-markov-model-to-here-is-how-markov-models-work-1ac5f4629b71) to generate sentences using [my PhD thesis](https://orca.cf.ac.uk/68365/) as input. I also posted about [the {markovifyR} package](https://github.com/abresler/markovifyR) for [generating lyrics by The Mountain Goats](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/04/25/gen-tmg-lyrics/).

This is a quick update to that original post, but this time I'm using {markovifyR}.

## Some code

The PhD text is available from my {dray} package on GitHub:

```{r dray, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/dray")
```

I'll remove the blank lines and ignore the preamble and references section. As a reminder, the thesis is about the decomposition of tree litter that's been exposed to environmental stressors like elevated carbon dioxide levels and acidified streams.

```{r phd-text}
phd_text <- dray::phd  # get data
phd_text <- phd_text[nchar(phd_text) > 0]  # remove blank lines
phd_text <- phd_text[27:376]  # ignore preamble and references
phd_text[1:2]
```

Now to prepare the work space. {markovifyR} is a wrapper of the `markovify` Python module. You first need to install `markovify`. You can do this from the command line with `pip3 install markovify`, for example (though this will depend on the version of Python you have). You can also run command-line code from R with a call to `system()`:

```{r system, eval=FALSE}
system("pip3 install markovify")
```

And then ensure you've installed {markovifyR} from GitHub and also the dependency {furrr}.

```{r makovifyr-furrr, message=FALSE}
library(markovifyR)   # remotes::install_github("abresler/markovifyR")
library(furrr)  # install.packages("furrr")
```

The function `generate_markovify_model()` builds the model and `markovify_text()` generate some sentences based on that model.

```{r model}
# Build model
markov_model <- generate_markovify_model(
  input_text = phd_text,
  markov_state_size = 2L,
  max_overlap_total = 25,
  max_overlap_ratio = 0.7
)

# Generate lines
phd_speak <- markovify_text(
  markov_model = markov_model,
  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,
  output_column_name = "phd_speak",
  count = 50,
  tries = 50,
  only_distinct = TRUE,
  return_message = FALSE
)

head(phd_speak)
```

I haven't spent much time tweaking the arguments in `generate_markovify_model()`, but the results are pretty amusing anyway.

## Robo-thesis

I ran this a few times and picked some favourites.

| Output | Hot take |
| :----- | :------- |
| _In general, litter chemical composition and decomposition._ | This is the ultimate summary of my thesis. |
| _This thesis is the total nitrogen content of the North American Benthological Society._ | I'm sure the NABS has more nitrogen in its possession. |
| _This simplicity has allowed for broad underlying principles to be linked to litter chemical composition differently depending on whether it was exposed to a labeled 0.5 m steel rod._ | Holy smokes, who knew that the steel rods were the deciding factor? Were they radioactive or something? |
| _Deciduous woodlands are dependent on the parent tree._ | Yes, all deciduous woodlands have one central master tree from which all the others are descended. |
| _Currently there is a key ecosystem process in temperate deciduous woodlands and streams._ | Yes, but what is it? I must know! |
| _Canadian Journal of the laboratory in a randomly-ordered 3 × 3 grid._ | That is one niche academic journal. |
| _I am grateful for the choice test._ | I designed and ran it, so I have only myself to thank. |
| _My parents have never wavered in their responses, suggesting that caution has to be available online in the CEF._ | It seems the Controlled Environment Facility (CEF) cannot control for the effect of parental input; best to provide some guidance on what to do if parental influence is strong. |
| _Bonferroni-adjusted critical significance levels were compared by pairwise PERMANOVA._ | That sure sounds like statistics! |
| _This reduced decomposition rate in the University’s Open Access repository and for inter-library loan, and for inter-library loan, and for inter-library loans._ | Ah good, slower-decomposing books will last longer; apparently this is important for inter-library loans? |

## Very science, much thesis

Once again, simply copy and paste several of these sentences into your own thesis. The benefit is that you won't have to grow any trees in a high carbon-dioxide atmosphere; you won't have to spend months packing leaves into tiny bags; you won't have to attach those bags to tens of IKEA cutlery holders and dunk them in frozen streams in mid-Wales; you won't have to grind those leaves into a suspicious-looking powder and transport them cross-country for chemical analyses; you won't have to imprison any insects against their will. You are welcome.

Good luck at your viva!
