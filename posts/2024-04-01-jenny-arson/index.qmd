## tl;dr

Make RStudio restart itself. Perpetually.

## Passing the torch

[Jenny once said](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/):

> If the first line of your R script is `rm(list = ls())` I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE üî•.

The objects in your R environment are wicked little imps whose only motivation is to deceive you. They must be destroyed. Frequently. 

But `rm()` isn't enough to start with a completely a clean slate. It doesn't detach packages, for example. Reproducibility is at stake here, folks!

The only salvation is to completely restart R. All the time.

I don't think you heard me. Come closer. I said _all the time_.

## An extinguisher

I've been [woke to this thought technology](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2020-04-17-r-self-shame/index.html#env) for a while. You're right, it's time I gave back to the community.

I can't trust you to restart R voluntarily, so I must help you to help yourself.

So, I have for you a gift. A precious snippet of R code that came to me in a fever dream.

```{r}
setHook(
  "rstudio.sessionInit",
  function(...) {
    message("‚è≥ You have 30 seconds...")
    Sys.sleep(30)
    rstudioapi::executeCommand("restartR")
  }
)
```

Simply open your `.Rprofile` ([a special file](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/360047157094-Managing-R-with-Rprofile-Renviron-Rprofile-site-Renviron-site-rsession-conf-and-repos-conf) that's executed at start up) with `usethis::edit_r_profile()`[^dont1], paste in the code[^dont2] and then restart R for it to take effect[^dont3].

What does it do? When RStudio starts up it waits for 30 seconds and restarts R[^thespicemelange].

...Which prompts another restart after 30 more seconds.

...And another.

...Forever[^quit].

![trapped in a loop help I'm](resources/restart.png){fig.alt="The R console in RStudio. Repeated several times is the texrt 'restarting in 30 seconds...' then 'restarting R session'." width='100%'}

I know what you're thinking: doesn't this block the console? Kind of. You can still type stuff and it'll be executed before the next restart. Only to disappear immediately. 

Just like Jenny wanted! I think?

## Rise from the ashes

How can you thank me for this? I am humble (extremely), but you're welcome to [support my Patreon](https://github.com/scrogster/rickrollR/).

Happy March 32nd, colleagues.

[^dont1]: Don't.
[^dont2]: Don't.
[^dont3]: Fine, [do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCscYsICvoA).
[^quit]: Maybe you'll have to force quit RStudio? Use <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> on a Macintosh or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Delete</kbd> on Michaelsoft Binbows. I don't need to tell Linux users what to do because they claim to know what they're doing.
[^thespicemelange]: If you're feeling extra spicy, maybe randomise the wait period!
