## tl;dr

Some people look at an R script and see code. But I _feel_ something.

## A philosophy

Have you experienced the [Aesthetics Wiki](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics_Wiki)?

It's missing R-related entries for some reason, which definitely fit [the aesthetic philosophy](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Philosophy) of having:

> perspectives on beauty and the human condition and a political, economic, or social statement

Tell me you don't look at an R script and get an immediate vibe.

I want to suggest two obvious aesthetics for submission to the wiki—_Basecore_ and _Tidywave_—and to introduce the definitely-soon-to-be-mainstreamed _V4 Punk_[^suffix].

## The addendum

### Basecore

![Adapted from [Aesthetics Wiki](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aesthetics/images/1/15/Chaotic_academia.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200610213320).](resources/chaotic-academia.png){fig.alt="A set of different-sized books haphazardly placed ona bookshelf." width='100%'}

#### Overview

* History: emerged as Base Academic in 1993, mainstreamed as Base Core from 2000 to date.
* Visuals: `[` (square-bracket selector), `$` (dollar selector), `~` (formula-form tilde).
* Media: [_Writing R Extensions_](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html), the [R-help mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help), that textfile with a [Y2K warning](https://fosstodon.org/@mattdray/111125184484188641) that came bundled with R v1.0.
* Fashion: cardigans, a wired mouse with a ball in it, the old-school IDE you get when you click 'R.app' instead of 'RStudio.app'.
* Palette: <span style="background-color:lightgrey;">grey</span>.
* Nearest aesthetic: [Chaotic Academia](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Chaotic_Academia), which 'acknowledges the pretentiousness of classic academia, subtly mocking it at times'.

#### Sample

Classic stuff. Typical base-R code uses a lot of intermediate assignment to create temporary objects for further manipulation. Many actions make use of square bracket notation to indicate some action over rows and columns of a data.frame. Data.frame columns have to be called within the context of the data.frame they belong to, using dollar or square-bracket notation. The tilde is used for formula notation ('this given that').

<details><summary>Set up demo data</summary>
```{r}
#| label: setup

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
sw_a <- starwars[, c("name", "species", "height")]
sw_b <- starwars[, c("name", "homeworld")]
```
</details>

```{r}
#| label: basecore

x <- sw_a[sw_a$species == "Human", names(sw_a) != "species"]
x <- merge(x, sw_b, by = "name")
x$height <- x$height / 100
x$homeworld <- ifelse(
  !x$homeworld %in% c("Tatooine", "Naboo"),
  "Other",
  x$homeworld
)
x <- aggregate(x, height ~ homeworld, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
x <- x[order(-x$height), ]
x
```

### Tidywave

#### Overview

* History: humble academic origins in 2008, later popularised with the creation of the {tidyverse} in 2016.
* Visuals: `%>%` ({magrittr} pipe), `.` (data placeholder), `~` (lambda function).
* Media: [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), conflict warnings in the console when you do `library(tidyverse)`, that one gif of Hadley tapping merrily on an invisible keyboard ('just typing R code!').
* Fashion: RStudio, hex stickers, rapid deprecation.
* Palette: Posit <span style="background-color:#1a162d;color:white;">blue</span>, <span style="background-color:#fdeba4;">yellow</span>, and <span style="background-color:#767381;color:white;">grey</span>.
* Nearest aesthetic: [Corporate Memphis](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Corporate_Memphis) because I've literally seen it in Posit marketing.

#### Sample

The script reads from left-to-right and top-to-bottom, recipe style, using pipes: 'take dataset, then do a thing, then do a thing', etc. Each function is verb that indicates its action. Non-standard evaluation is rampant. A tilde replaces the tedious typing of <kbd>f</kbd><kbd>u</kbd><kbd>n</kbd><kbd>c</kbd><kbd>t</kbd><kbd>i</kbd><kbd>o</kbd><kbd>n</kbd><kbd>(</kbd><kbd>)</kbd>. A titchy inconspicuous `.` acts as a data placeholder on the right-hand side of a pipe.

```{r}
#| label: tidywave

sw_a %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  select(-species) %>%
  left_join(sw_b, by = "name") %>%
  mutate(
    height = height / 100,
    homeworld = if_else(
      !homeworld %in% c("Tatooine", "Naboo"),
      "Other",
      homeworld
    )
  ) %>%
  summarise(
    height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE),
    .by = homeworld
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(height))
```

#### V4 Punk

![Adapted from [Aesthetics Wiki](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aesthetics/images/d/d1/Magnum-pi-hawaiian-shirt.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200507215616).](resources/vacation-dadcore.png){fig.alt="Tom Sellick in a Hawaiian shirt at the beach, leaning against a palm tree. He is smiling." width='100%'}

#### Overview

* History: incremental emergence following R version 4.0 in 2020, boosted greatly in 2022 with the release of the base pipe. The future of R.
* Visuals: `|>` (base pipe), `_` (data placeholder), `\()` (lambda function).
* Media: meme blogs, cheeky Fosstodon posts.
* Fashion: hubris, evil moustaches, troll-face emojis.
* Palette: <span style="background-color:#ff0000;">r</span><span style="background-color:#ff00ff;">a</span><span style="background-color:#00ffff;">i</span><span style="background-color:#00ff00;">n</span><span style="background-color:#0000ff;color:white;">b</span><span style="background-color:#4b0082;color:white;">o</span><span style="background-color:#ee82ee;">w</span>?
* Nearest aesthetic: [Vacation Dadcore](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Vacation_Dadcore), so you can 'escape to a simpler time without sacrificing any of the fun'.

#### Sample

Hear me out: what if tidyverse, but made entirely of base R functions[^modern]? This is now possible with the base pipe and by using obscure functions that help you avoid square brackets[^poorman]. It's also sketchy as heck; just see the help files for `subset()` ('unanticipated consequences') and `transform()` ('you deserve whatever you get!'). The death of Basecore and Tidywave, for sure.

```{r}
#| label: four-point-oh-punk

sw_a |>
  subset(
    species == "Human",
    select = -species
  ) |>
  merge(sw_b, by = "name") |>
  transform(
    height = height / 100,
    homeworld = ifelse(
      !homeworld %in% c("Tatooine", "Naboo"),
      "Other",
      homeworld
    )
  ) |>
  aggregate(
    height ~ homeworld, 
    \(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  sort_by(~ height, decreasing = TRUE)  # hot off the v4.4 press
```

Can't wait to see this roll out into production code.

[^suffix]: These [suffixes are meaningful](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Suffix_Meaning): core 'implies a system, a set of rules', wave 'a significant shift within a genre' and punk 'reject[s] social norms'.
[^modern]: I called this 'The Modern Base Aesthetic' in [my talk, 'Base Slaps!'](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2023-10-17-nhs-r-2023/), at the NHS-R conference 2023. But now I realise the aesthetics run deeper.
[^poorman]: If you truly want something that looks like {dplyr} code but depends only on base R, then check out [the {poorman} package](https://nathaneastwood.github.io/poorman/).
