## tl;dr

Fun and learning with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), usually off-piste. It's a bonus if you find any of it useful and/or amusing. All views belong to us.

I use R professionally for analysis and reproducibility, and as an amateur for memes and ironic trolling. I make R do odd things, often with the aid of important pop-culture references like Pok√©mon and Dawson's Creek.

My job involves using R to understand the health of nature globally. I spend at least 50% of my spare time talking through Matt's latest idea about what weird thing he could do with R.
